/// Where your photo library says you have been.
///
/// The oldest trick in this map and, until now, the clumsiest to use. A photo
/// carries the coordinate it was taken at, so a library is a record of
/// everywhere you have been with a camera in your hand — which for most people
/// is a better record of the last decade than anything they deliberately kept.
/// Getting at it used to mean running a command over an export and importing the
/// file it produced. The library is *on this phone*. There is no reason to go
/// via a file at all.
///
/// ## Nothing is read but two numbers and a date
///
/// `PHAsset` carries `location` and `creationDate` as metadata, so this never
/// opens an image, never asks for image data, never touches iCloud, and cannot
/// download anything. A library of eighty thousand photographs is read in a
/// second or two because it is a database query, not a file walk. What leaves
/// the phone is a list of `[lat, lng, t]` — the same shape a location fix takes,
/// folded by the same code on the other side. That is as true as it ever was:
/// the overlay that shows a photograph opens it on this phone, for the card in
/// front of you, and no image is uploaded by anything here.
///
/// ## It replaces rather than adds
///
/// Every other source is a partial account of a period, so folding it in is
/// right. A library is not a period: it is the whole answer to "where have I
/// taken a picture", and a photo deleted from it is a claim withdrawn. So a scan
/// sends the library entire and the server replaces what it held — which is also
/// what lets this take over cleanly from the old file-derived import.
///
/// ## Uploading is not the same decision as looking
///
/// The map's photo overlay reads the same library through ``PhotoBridge``, and
/// it does not consult the switch below. Wanting to see where your photographs
/// were taken and wanting the places they were taken to become part of your map
/// are two different questions, and only one of them is asked here.
