/// This is a file rather than an array because of what it is standing between:
/// a phone that gets woken for a second at a time, in a tunnel, on a train, with
/// the server unreachable — and a map whose whole claim is *I was here*. A fix
/// held only in memory is a fix lost to the next time iOS decides the app has
/// had enough. So each one is on disk before the delegate method returns, and
/// leaves only when a 200 says it is somewhere better.
///
/// The format is one `lat,lng,t` per line. It is append-only in the common case,
/// which is the operation that has to be cheap and safe; the rewrite happens
/// only after a successful push, when there is time.
