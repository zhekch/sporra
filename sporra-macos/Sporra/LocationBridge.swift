/// Where the page's "my location" button gets its position, on a Mac.
///
/// ## Why the browser's own geolocation is not used
///
/// It does not work here, and that was measured rather than assumed. In a
/// `WKWebView` on macOS the page is a secure context, WebKit *does* ask the app
/// for permission — `requestGeolocationPermissionFor` is called, and granted —
/// and then no position ever arrives. `getCurrentPosition` fires neither
/// callback, which is why the map's locate button span for ever instead of
/// failing: MapLibre waits on a promise that is never settled, and a spinner
/// with no timeout is what "nothing came back" looks like.
///
/// **And below macOS 27 it cannot work at all**, whatever WebKit does with the
/// position: `webView:requestGeolocationPermissionForOrigin:…` is
/// `API_AVAILABLE(macos(27.0))`, so on the macOS 14 this app supports there is
/// no way for a web view to be granted the permission in the first place. A fix
/// that depended on WebKit would work on one OS version out of fourteen.
///
/// So the position comes from here. The app already has CoreLocation, already
/// has the entitlement, and already asks for the authorization — everything the
/// page needed was on this side of the bridge the whole time.
///
/// ## The page is not asked to cooperate
///
/// Unlike ``PhotoBridge`` and ``SaveBridge``, which the web app knows about and
/// calls deliberately, nothing in `src/` knows this exists. A user script
/// replaces `navigator.geolocation` with a shim backed by this handler before
/// the first line of the page runs, so MapLibre's control — and anything else
/// asking the standard question — gets a standard answer. That keeps the site
/// free of a special case for one host, which is the same bargain the rest of
/// this app strikes.
///
/// The iPhone app needs none of this: iOS WebKit delivers positions perfectly
/// well, which is why the same page works there untouched.
