/// Recording where the Mac has been.
///
/// ## What this is, and is not, on a Mac
///
/// On the phone this is the reason the app exists: recording your position with
/// the screen off is the one thing a web page categorically cannot do. Here the
/// claim is smaller and worth stating plainly, because the difference is easy to
/// assume away.
///
/// **A Mac records while the app is running.** macOS does not relaunch an app
/// for a location event and does not wake a sleeping machine to take a fix, so
/// there is no equivalent of the phone's "swiped away and still logging". Quit
/// Sporra and nothing is recorded until you open it again; close the window
/// and it keeps going, which is why `applicationShouldTerminateAfterLastWindowClosed`
/// answers false. A closed lid is asleep, and asleep is not anywhere.
///
/// That makes this genuinely useful on a laptop that travels and nearly useless
/// on a desktop that does not, which is why the switch starts off — see
/// ``TrackingSettings/Cadence``.
///
/// ## Two services, not one
///
/// **Significant-change monitoring** runs whenever tracking is on, at every
/// cadence. On the phone its job is survival — it is the only service that
/// relaunches a terminated app. Here it cannot do that, so it is kept for the
/// duller half of the same reason: it is coarse, roughly half a kilometre,
/// costs almost nothing, and is exactly what "only when I go somewhere" means.
///
/// **Standard updates** run on top of it for every cadence but that one, and are
/// what the interval settings actually mean.
///
/// ## Why the fixes ask for ten metres
///
/// `desiredAccuracy` is `kCLLocationAccuracyNearestTenMeters`. A cell is about
/// 50 m across, so a hundred-metre fix lands in a different one. A Mac has no
/// GPS chip and often cannot answer to ten metres — wifi positioning is what
/// it has — and a fix it reports as worse than a cell is dropped by the
/// precision setting rather than painted in the wrong hex. Asking is still
/// worth it: a fix the machine can answer that well should be kept, which was
/// not true when a cell was 900 m and both answers were the same hex.
