/// The iPhone app opens the same screen from the site — Personal ▸ App
/// settings — because a phone has no menu bar. A Mac has one, so the second
/// window lives where every Mac app keeps its settings and is reachable from
/// the same keystroke as everyone else's.
///
/// `Window` rather than `WindowGroup`, and that is not cosmetic: a group lets
/// ⌘N open a second copy, and a second copy here means a second `WKWebView`,
/// a second service worker registration and a second map holding the same tiles
/// in memory. There is one map.
