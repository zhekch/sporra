    // None of that applies to a window with a title bar. The web view starts
    // below the title bar and ends at the frame, so every edge is genuinely
    // clear and the `env(…, 0px)` defaults in `src/style.css` are already right.

    // It is also why this window keeps its title bar rather than hiding it for a
    // full-bleed map. `.hud` in src/style.css sits 20 px from the top left, and
    // that is exactly where the traffic lights would be — a map drawn under them
    // would need this machinery back, to work around a problem it chose.
