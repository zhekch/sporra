# Run it from anywhere; it finds its own folder. That is the whole point of it
# existing. The command this replaces hardcoded the repo path four times, and by
# the time it was retired every one of them was wrong: this folder has been
# renamed more than once and moved a level deeper, and none of those are the
# kind of change anyone thinks to grep an old shell command for.
#
# The failure is silent in the worst way. `git pull` and `npm run build` succeed
# in whatever directory you were already standing in, so only the `node` on the
# end fails — after everything before it has reported success.
#
# So there is one path in this file, on the line below, and it is derived rather
# than written down. Everything after the `cd` is relative, and the next rename
# costs nothing.
#
# Three things this does differently from the command it replaces, each of which
# was a real failure rather than a tidy-up:
#
#   It kills by port, not `killall node`. That killall took down every node
#   process on the machine — other projects' dev servers, editor tooling, MCP
#   servers — to restart one of them.
#
#   It builds before it kills. A chain that stopped the server first and then
#   failed to build left nothing running, which is the one outcome a restart
#   should never produce.
#
#   It backgrounds only the server. Written as `a && b && c & disown`, the `&`
#   applies to the entire list, so the pull and the build were detached too and
#   their output went nowhere: a failed build looked exactly like a good one.

#   merge: sporra-webserver/package-lock.json
#
# which is this script having broken its own next run, and it happens on
# exactly the commits that matter: the ones that changed a dependency, which
# are the ones where the pull is carrying something the build needs.
#
# So the lockfile is restored before pulling, and **only** the lockfile. It is
# generated, npm owns it, and `npm install` regenerates it from package.json a
# few lines below — there is nothing in it to lose here. Anything else dirty
# still stops the pull, which is right: a tracked file edited on a deploy box
# is something a person should look at, not something a script should throw
# away to save itself a restart.
