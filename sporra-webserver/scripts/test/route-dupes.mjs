// The same ride, recorded twice.
//
// A route's identity is a hash of its own simplified geometry plus its dates,
// which is exactly right for "you already imported this file" and no use at all
// here: two apps watching one afternoon produce two different point streams,
// which simplify to two different lines, which hash to two different keys. Both
// rows are legitimate, distinct data about one ride, and the map drew the line
// twice, listed it twice, and counted its kilometres twice.
//
// The thresholds below are set from what real duplicates look like rather than
// from what felt safe, and the measurement that matters is the start offset as
// a *fraction of the outing*: an hour's run recorded twice agrees to within
// thirteen seconds, a six-hour ski day drifts up to twenty minutes, and both
// land under 5.9% of the shorter recording. The closest thing on the same map
// that must not fold sits at 257%.
//
// The cases that matter are the ones that must NOT fold — two laps of the same
// loop, an out-and-back done twice in a day, a ride with no clock. Getting a
// duplicate wrong hides something you did.
