// Standing in an airport, against the real dataset.
//
// The two ways this goes wrong are opposites:
//
//   - too tight a radius and it answers "no" from inside the terminal, which is
//     the only place anybody ever asks it from. A record is the airport
//     reference point and an airport is kilometres across.
//   - too loose, or drawn from the wrong group, and a kitchen a few kilometres
//     from a regional field counts as being at an airport.
//
// So the cases below are real terminals, real city centres a few kilometres from
// real airports, and the seam — because Anadyr and Nadi are both airports with
// scheduled flights sitting on ±180°, where a naive longitude difference puts a
// phone in the terminal 360° away from the field it is standing on.
