// This layer has a failure mode nothing else in the app has: **its other half is
// in another language.** The page asks `sporraPhotos` for `points`, `photo`
// and `open`; a Swift file two directories away switches on those exact strings,
// and neither compiler nor bundler has ever seen both. Rename one and the app
// still builds, still runs, and answers every question with "unknown" — which
// looks like a phone that has no photographs on it.
//
// So most of this is the two halves read against each other. The rest is the
// handful of things that are wrong in a way you cannot see: a swapped
// coordinate pair puts a summer in Zürich off the coast of Somalia, a card whose
// element ids have drifted from the markup fills in nothing at all, and a
// browser that somehow believed it could answer would offer a switch that does
// nothing.
