// What one visit is.
//
// `hits` is the number the heat map ramps on and the number the card prints, and
// it is the easiest thing in this codebase to get quietly wrong, because every
// wrong answer is still a plausible integer. It used to count *arrivals* —
// fixes more than an hour apart — which meant a coffee run out and back counted
// twice and a week at home counted every time the phone woke up after an hour's
// silence. One cell of a real map held 1,837 of those against 103 actual stays.
//
// It now counts stays: fixes go on being one visit until a whole day passes with
// none (`VISIT_GAP_SEC`). The cases below pin that from both directions — what
// has to merge into one visit, and what has to stay separate — plus the
// fallback for files that carry no clock at all.
