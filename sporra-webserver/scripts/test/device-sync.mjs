// The phone pushing its own position, and its workouts, through the real API.
//
// This is the one connector that pushes, and pushing brings a failure the
// pollers cannot have: the app does not know whether a batch landed. A 200 that
// is lost on the way back looks exactly like a timeout, and the queue is
// retried — so "the same fixes twice" is the *normal* case rather than the
// pathological one, and a map that counted them twice would quietly inflate
// every place you have been.
//
// Both guards against that are tested here, because both are arithmetic that
// looks right until it is run: the device cursor (fixes), and the remembered
// workout ids (activities). The seam between two batches of one continuous stay
// is the third — it is the same subtraction Home Assistant does, arrived at
// through a different door.
