// Three things here are worth a test and the rest is decoration:
//
//   - "in winter" is answered against the *map's* latitude, not the viewer's, so
//     the southern hemisphere has to get the opposite half of the year. This is
//     the bug that would not be noticed for six months, in either direction.
//   - `applySnow` is called on a MapLibre map (the flat three, and satellite
//     with no token) and must do nothing at all rather than throw — the
//     feature does not exist there and never will.
//   - the mode is read back from storage on every load, and anything unknown has
//     to land on `off`. A stored value from a future build must not switch snow
//     on permanently with no control that admits to it.

// *nothing* was applied and there was no snow at all, on any basemap, in any
// month. It fires an error on the map rather than throwing, so `applySnow`'s
// try/catch saw nothing wrong and went on reporting snow as on.

// next tuning constant nudged past a limit fails here instead of on a phone in
