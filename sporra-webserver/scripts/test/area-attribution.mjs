// Which region a cell belongs to — the question the map's region level and the
// statistics panel both ask, and for a long time answered differently.
//
// The map used to resolve a cell's region from the centre of the 9 km hexagon
// it had been rolled up into. Plenty of regions are smaller than that hexagon,
// so the centre regularly landed somewhere the cells did not: a real map lit
// Appenzell Innerrhoden and reported "3 visits" off seven cells that were all
// in Sankt Gallen, and did the same to Liechtenstein's Mauren and the Aosta
// Valley. The statistics panel, reading each cell where it actually is, listed
// none of the three — so the map and the panel disagreed about the same rows,
// and the panel was right.
//
// The cases below pin the fix from both ends: a cell is attributed to the
// region it is in and not to whichever region a hexagon around it is centred
// on, and the set of regions the map lights is exactly the set the statistics
// count. The fixtures are named towns rather than anyone's history — the bug
// is a property of the geometry, and needs no location data to show.
