// The 3D basemap: the token it will not accept, the light it is shown in, and
// the two anchors that become slots.
//
// What this cannot test is Standard rendering, and that is not a gap it can
// close: Standard is drawn by Mapbox GL JS against somebody's private token, so
// a check of it would only ever pass on one laptop. What is left is everything
// that is decided *before* a tile is asked for, which is where the mistakes
// worth catching actually were:
//
//   - a secret token (`sk.`) works perfectly well against Mapbox and must be
//     refused anyway, because anything in a web page is public. GL JS does
//     refuse it, deep inside a URL builder, as an exception thrown mid-render —
//     far too late to tell anyone which box was wrong.
//   - two of the four light presets turn the map dark, and everything the app
//     decides from a theme follows. A preset that reported the wrong theme
//     would give you white chrome on a night map.
//   - the wash anchor and the label anchor are layer ids on MapLibre and slots
//     on Standard. Getting the slot wrong is not an error anywhere: the layer is
//     accepted, drawn in the wrong place, and the visited colour ends up over
//     the buildings instead of under them.

// --- Control classes across a library switch ------------------------------------

// loads the incoming library before taking the outgoing map down, so from then
// until the new map exists, `ctrlClass` names the library that is arriving and
// the buttons on screen still belong to the one that is leaving.
//
// That is the moment the geolocate control's state is read, to be put back on
// the new map. Read under one prefix it matched nothing, the answer came back
// "off", and the blue dot quietly did not return — twice, because the fix for
// it was written on the wrong side of the load. So reading names both.

// --- What Standard is told about itself -----------------------------------------

// the style's own schema and returns without a word when it is not there. So a
// property never sent and a property misspelled look identical from the outside
// — a plain extrusion where a landmark should be, and nothing in the console.
//
// That silence is why the Bundeshaus-as-a-warehouse was blamed on this file
// twice. It was never this file: the models were blocked by the server's
// `script-src`, which had no wasm source, and Mapbox GL JS decodes the batched
// landmark meshes in WebAssembly. `scripts/test/csp.mjs` is the check that
// belongs to that, and it exists because this one cannot see it — nothing about
// a config property can tell you the renderer was not allowed to run.
//
// There is no way to check these names against Mapbox's schema from here either
// — it arrives with the style, which needs a token and a network. What can be
// checked is that every one of them is actually sent, and that one the renderer
// does not know cannot take the others down with it.

// obvious spelling of this does — answers "off" for a control that is tracking.
// `restoreGeolocate('off')` returns immediately, so the dot did not come back.
//
// That is the state that matters: it is where panning or zooming away from
// yourself lands, and `dropLockOnZoom` puts you there on purpose. The dot
