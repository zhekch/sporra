// Which airport a point is standing in, if any.
//
// Which airport a coordinate is standing in. The dataset is 5,272 records a
// client should not have to carry: bundling one would mean a generated resource
// that goes stale silently. The phone used to ask this to wish you a good
// flight; the endpoint stays because the question is still a question, and a
// phone at an airport has a network by definition.
//
// **Only airports with scheduled service.** `airports-airline.json` is already
// the narrowest of the four groups, and this narrows it again to the ones an
// airline actually flies from. The other 44,000 entries are airfields, helipads
// and closed strips: a flying club on the edge of town is somewhere you can
// legitimately spend an afternoon, and "happy flight" is a strange thing to be
// told while you are mowing a runway. A wrong notification is worse here than a
// missing one, because the missing one costs nothing and the wrong one is the
// app being odd at you.
//
// **The radius is by size and it is generous.** A record is one point — the
// airport reference point, usually near the middle of the field — and an airport
// is not a point. Frankfurt is four kilometres across and Dallas/Fort Worth is
// seven, so a tight radius answers "no" from inside the terminal, which is the
// only place this question is ever asked from. Being generous costs the case
// where somebody lives beside a runway, and they will be told to have a happy
// flight once, and then not again for hours (see the phone's own cooldown).
