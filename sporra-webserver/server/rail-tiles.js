// The train-tracks overlay's tiles, fetched once for everyone and kept.
//
// **Read this before changing how often it asks upstream.** OpenRailwayMap's
// vector services are hosted "on a best-effort basis using limited resources"
// and their usage policy (USAGE.md in hiddewie/OpenRailwayMap-vector) is short
// enough to quote the parts that shaped this file:
//
//   - "Map tiles may be used in third party applications, on the condition that
//      the third-party application is available publicly and without
//      registration."
//   - "Map tiles may not be downloaded using automated processes or in bulk."
//   - "Usage of the OpenRailwayMap services requires sending a valid `Referer`
//      header (browser applications) or `User-agent` header (automated
//      processes). These headers may not be faked."
//
// This map is behind an account, and a server-side cache is by definition an
// automated process fetching tiles. Both of those are a deliberate, informed
// departure from the letter of that policy, made because the alternative — every
// browser on every device asking them directly, forever — is worse for them.
// What that obliges this file to do:
//
//   **Nothing is ever fetched that a person did not just look at.** There is no
//   seeding, no prefetch, no walking a bounding box, no warming the cache on
//   boot. A tile enters this cache because a viewport asked for it, which is the
//   one thing that keeps "cache" from meaning "bulk download".
//
//   **It says who it is.** `USER_AGENT` names the project and links to it. If
//   they want to throttle or block this, the header is how, and that is the
//   point of it.
//
//   **And it sends a true Referer.** Their nginx answers 403 to any request
//   without one — every combination of User-Agent was tried and none of them is
//   the thing it checks — so the policy's "or `User-agent` header (automated
//   processes)" is not what the server actually implements. The header sent is
//   *this map's own public origin*, resolved per request from the host the
//   browser reached us on. That is the honest answer to what Referer asks: the
//   site on whose behalf the tile is being fetched. Claiming to be
//   openrailwaymap.app would get past the same gate and is exactly the faked
//   header the policy forbids, so it is not done.
//
//   **A repeat costs them a 304 or nothing at all.** Entries outlive their TTL
//   and are revalidated with `If-None-Match`, so the common case for a tile that
//   has not changed is a few hundred bytes rather than a few kilobytes — and
//   inside the TTL it is no request whatsoever.
//
//   **Their outage is not their problem twice.** When upstream fails, a stale
//   entry is served rather than retried in a loop. `MAX_UPSTREAM` caps how many
//   requests can ever be in flight at once, so a cold cache and a hundred tiles
//   on screen is still a trickle.
//
// If the traffic ever stops being personal-scale, the honest fix is not a bigger
// cache here — it is running their stack locally per their SETUP.md and setting
// `RAIL_ORIGIN` to it, which needs no change to any of this.
//
// **Storage.** One file per entry, body prefixed by a single-line JSON header,
// written through a temp name and renamed so a half-written file can never be
// read back as a complete answer. The metadata travels with the bytes, which is
// why there is no index to fall out of step with the directory. Bodies are
// stored gzipped — vector tiles are protobuf and compress to about a third —
// and served that way to the ~every client that accepts it.

// style, which reads it, labels a Tokyo suburban line in Japanese and a Greek
// branch in Greek, on top of a basemap that is already labelling both in English.
//
// `?lang=` is the whole ask, and it is a **query parameter on the tile**, which
// makes it part of what a cached entry *is*. It is in the key below for that
// reason: without it, switching this would go on serving what was fetched under
// the old one until the last of it aged out — a day, since that is the `max-age`
// they send and `ttlFrom` honours it. TILE_TTL_MS below is only the fallback for
// an answer that carries no `Cache-Control` at all.
//
// Not per-request and not read off the browser: this is one map with one set of
// labels on it, and a per-language cache would multiply every tile by however
// many languages happened to visit. `name` is still in the tile, and their style
// puts it under the English one wherever the two differ, so nothing is lost —

// in a way worth remembering: shared across sources it let their permanently
// broken `standard` composite silence the healthy track geometry, and even once
// it was per-source it still blanked the railways for a minute at a time during
// an outage that the per-tile backoff below was already handling. A pause that
// makes the map worse without meaningfully sparing their server is not
// politeness, it is just a pause.
//
// The backoff *is* the protection, and it is the better shape of it: a tile that
// failed is not asked again for thirty seconds, then a minute, then two, up to
// half an hour, so repeated panning over the same broken ground costs nothing
// while ground nobody has looked at yet is still fetched immediately.
// `MAX_UPSTREAM` caps how much of that can be in flight at once.

// **How much detail is worth asking for.**
//
// When their origin is down, everything still being served anywhere — their site

// outage, and whether a given tile works is simply whether it is still in the
// edge cache. That is not uniform across zooms: there are sixteen times as many
// distinct tiles at z14 as at z12, so a z14 tile is far less likely to have been
// asked for recently by anyone, and far more likely to miss.
//
// So a zoom that is failing is worth *stepping down from* rather than retrying.
// MapLibre will happily overzoom a parent tile — coarser, but railways on the
// screen instead of nothing — and it does the rescaling correctly because it
// knows the tile is a parent. It only needs to be told, via the source's
// `maxzoom`, not to ask for the deeper ones.
//
