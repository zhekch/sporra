// Cells are stored one row per (cell, source) in `cell_sources`, so a cell can
// carry provenance from several imports at once and re-importing a source just
// refreshes its own rows. See the table comment below.
//
// Saved routes (the line a GPX/KML track actually drew) live in their own
// `routes` table — they're drawn over the map, not folded into it, and a route
// is identified by a hash of its own geometry so a re-import is a no-op.
//
// Home Assistant is the one source the server fetches itself: it polls your own
// instance for `device_tracker`/`person` history and merges the fixes as source
// 'home-assistant'. Nothing is inferred between them — a fix is a fix.
//
// In dev, Vite (5173) serves the front-end and proxies /api here (3001). In
// production the server also serves the built dist/ folder, so one process
// hosts everything — run `npm run build` then `npm start`.
//
// Env: PORT (default 3001), DB_PATH (default ./data.db), COOKIE_SECURE=1 to add
// the Secure flag (set this behind HTTPS), IMPORT_OWNER=<username> to merge the
// baked-in imported history into that one account (default: unset — every new
// account starts empty and nobody gets it auto-filled), BACKUP_DIR (default
// ./backups) for where the timed copies of data.db are written,
// REGION_CACHE_DIR (default ./cache/regions) for the detailed boundary cache,
// RAIL_CACHE_DIR (default ./cache/rail) and RAIL_CACHE_BYTES (default 512 MB)
// for the OpenRailwayMap tile cache, TRAILS_CACHE_DIR (default ./cache/trails)
// and TRAILS_CACHE_BYTES (default 256 MB) for the Waymarked Trails one.

// so far has been some version of that — a browser replaying a year-old
// `immutable` response, a 304 served against a signature that could not see the

// two deploys ago. In each of them the map looked merely *wrong*, and there was
// nothing on screen to say the code you were reading was not the code that was
// running.
//
// A number you can read out loud settles that in one message. It is only worth
// anything if it moves, so move it — a patch bump for a fix, a minor for
// anything a user would notice. Stale here is worse than absent: a version that
// lies is how you rule out the very thing that is wrong.

// --- …and whether somebody has published a newer one ------------------------------

// This is self-hosted, and there is no update mechanism and no wish for one: it
// is updated by pulling and restarting, deliberately, by the person who runs
// it. What there was no way to know is *that there is anything to pull* — a
// server left running for three months looks exactly like one that is current,
// and the number at the foot of Settings could only ever describe itself.
//
// So the server asks, and the whole answer is the same constant read off the
// published copy. There are no releases and no tags to compare against; the
// version that means anything in this project is the one above, and the
// authoritative copy of it is the one on `main`.
//

//
//   • **The server asks, not the page.** One machine, one cache, one address
//     seen by GitHub — rather than every browser and every phone that opens
//     Settings announcing itself.
//   • **Sixteen kilobytes, not the file.** The constant is at the top, so the
//     request carries a `Range` header. A CDN that ignores it costs the whole
//     file and still works; one that honours it costs 16 KB.
//   • **It can be switched off**, and it is the only outbound request this
//     server makes that nobody configured. `UPDATE_CHECK=0` and it never runs.

// The page itself. script-src without 'unsafe-inline'/'unsafe-eval' is the part
// that matters: it means an injected string can't become running script, which
// is the difference between a defacement and an account takeover. blob: is there
// because MapLibre builds its worker from one. Styles keep 'unsafe-inline' —
// the colour picker writes style="background:…" into markup — and connect/img
// stay open to https: because the map legitimately talks to tile, geocoder and
// Komoot hosts, none of which are dangerous the way script execution is.
//
// **'wasm-unsafe-eval' is why Standard's landmarks are buildings and not sheds.**
// Mapbox GL JS decodes the batched meshes behind `mapbox-3dbuildings-v1` — the
// modelled station roofs, churches and parliaments — in WebAssembly, and a
// script-src without a wasm source blocks `WebAssembly.instantiate` outright.
// What that looks like is *not* an error anyone would connect to this line: the
// tiles are fetched, the layer stays visible, and every landmark draws as the
// plain extrusion it falls back to. It cost a long afternoon of reading
// Standard's config schema, because the map is only ever wrong **behind this
// server** — Vite's dev server sends no CSP, so localhost:5173 renders the
// models perfectly and the bug does not exist until it is deployed.
//
// Despite the name it is far narrower than 'unsafe-eval': it permits compiling
// WebAssembly and nothing else. `eval()`, `new Function` and friends stay
// refused, so a string injected into this page still cannot become running
// JavaScript, which is the whole point of the directive above. A browser too old
// to know the token ignores it and is back to plain extrusions — the same map it
// draws today, and no worse.
