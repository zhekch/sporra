// Swiping along a series: the chip that names the day, the chip that names
// one of that day's activities, and the month grid.
//
// Three places in this app show you one of a run of things — the day on the
// map, one activity of that day, and the month in the calendar — and in each
// the next question is always the one either side. Answering it used to mean
// the search palette, a grid, and a day picked out of it: four moves to step
// one day.
//
// So both take a horizontal swipe, which is what a series is for. It is the
// same gesture the photograph card takes (src/photo-info.js), deliberately:
// sideways over one of a series means *the next one* everywhere else on this
// device, and something that answered it differently would be a second thing to
// learn.
//
// **Three ways in, because there are three kinds of hand.** A finger drags it.
// A trackpad throws a stream of `wheel` events at it and no pointer events at
// all — the gesture anybody actually makes on a Mac, and the one that made this
// look broken there: the chip could be *dragged* with a mouse and could not be
// swiped. And a cursor has neither, so the arrows are buttons; see
// `.chip-arrow` in src/style.css and the calendar's own two.
//
// It is a gesture rather than two invisible buttons. The thing follows the
// finger, resists where there is nothing further to go, and can be changed its
// mind about by putting it back — a swipe that only reacts on release is one
// you cannot tell has been noticed, which is how you end up swiping twice and
// skipping one.

// different amounts depending on which part of the app it is over. The
// difficulty is the same too — a `wheel` event does not say which part of a
// gesture it is, so a firm flick and its second of coasting afterwards are one
// indistinguishable stream, and counting the coasting turns one swipe into
// thirty. See the long note by `WHEEL_LULL` in src/photo-info.js; this is that

 *
 * So a short silence only starts a new gesture if what breaks it is a *hand* —
