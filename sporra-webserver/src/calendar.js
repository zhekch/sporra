// The month grid, in the two places that ask "which weekend was that?".
//
// Its own grid rather than `<input type="date">`: the native picker is an
// opaque OS panel that cannot show which days have anything on them, and that
// is the only reason to open a calendar here at all.
//
// It lives in its own module because it has two hosts. The search palette has
// always had it; the Trips tab now does too, because browsing trips by name and
// browsing them by date are the same question asked twice, and they used to be
// two screens. Both hosts hand it the same three things — which days have
// something on them, which trip each day belongs to, and what to do when one is
// picked — and get back a grid that knows how to draw itself.
