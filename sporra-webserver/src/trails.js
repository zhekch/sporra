// The waymarked trails overlay — the hiking, cycling and winter routes that
// somebody has actually signed and painted onto a post, drawn over whatever
// basemap is underneath.
//
// **This one is pixels, and the railways are not.** That is the interesting
// difference between the two reference overlays, and it is a decision rather
// than an accident. OpenRailwayMap publishes vector tiles, so src/rail.js gets
// 288 layers it can restyle, filter, hit-test and recolour for a dark map.
// Waymarked Trails publishes PNGs and nothing else — there is no vector service
// to point at — so what arrives is ink, already coloured, already labelled by
// their cartographer, and unchangeable from here beyond an opacity.
//
// Three consequences, all of them visible from the outside:
//
//   **A tap cannot say what you hit.** `queryRenderedFeatures` over a raster
//   layer returns nothing, because there is nothing there to return: the tile is
//   a picture of a route, not the route. So the card a tap opens asks their API
//   *which routes run near this point* and says exactly that. It is a list of
//   candidates rather than an identification, and the wording is written to be
//   honest about it. Reading the tile's own alpha to narrow it down was tried on
//   paper and abandoned: ink under the finger proves a route is there, never
//   which of the four overlapping ones it belongs to, so it would buy a more
//   confident card and not a more correct one.
//
//   **It is drawn for a light background.** Their palette assumes a pale map
//   under it, which is true of one of this app's five basemaps. The overlay is
//   left alone rather than recoloured — `raster-hue-rotate` on somebody's
//   waymark colours would be inventing signage — and what changes per basemap is
//   the opacity, which is the one knob that cannot lie about what a route is.
//
//   **There are no retina tiles.** `@2x` is a 404 on their server, so on a
//   2× display this is the one soft thing on the map. Asking for tiles a zoom
//   deeper and letting the renderer shrink them would fix it and would cost
//   their servers four times the traffic for a cosmetic gain, which is the exact
//   trade server/trail-tiles.js exists to refuse.
//
// The tiles come through this app's own server. See the head of
// server/trail-tiles.js for why, and for what that obliges it to do.

// full strength is right — against 0.72 over a dark one, where the white casing
// around every route reads as glare and the routes stop being lines on a map and
// become a lit sign in front of it. The reasoning holds and the numbers were the
// wrong conclusion from it: near-full over Light is ink laid *on* the map rather
// than in it, and the difference between the two sides was never worth a basemap
// switch moving the slider under you. 0.75 is a route you can follow and a map
// you can still read underneath, either way round.
//
// It is still stored per basemap — see OPACITY_KEY — because a strength somebody
// *chooses* while looking at one map is still a statement about that map. What
// changed is what they are given before they choose anything.

// footpath in pale yellow stops being visible at all, which is the half of the

// --- Letting go of the tiles you are no longer looking at ---------------------------
//
// **This is why the routes thinned to hairlines on the 3D basemap and on no
// other.** Two of Mapbox's behaviours meet, and each is sensible alone.
//
// *A fading tile holds its children.* `SourceCache.update` keeps a tile's deeper
// children alive while that tile is still fading in, so a half-loaded zoom can
// go on showing the sharper picture it already has. Whether a tile is still
// fading is read off `Tile.fadeEndTime`, and that field has exactly one writer:
//
//     registerFadeDuration(duration) {
//       const fadeEndTime = duration + this.timeAdded;
//       if (fadeEndTime < now()) return;        // ← leaves it undefined
//       …
//     }
//
// With `raster-fade-duration: 0` — which this overlay wants, for the reason on
// `trailLayerSpec` — that test is true on every tile, every time, so
// **`fadeEndTime` is never written on anything**. A tile whose fade has no end
// never stops fading, so its children are never let go. Every z18 tile fetched
// while you were zoomed in is still in the source cache when you come back out,
// and the cache grows rather than turning over.
//
// *Draping prefers the deepest tile.* With terrain on, the layer is drawn into
// an offscreen texture per terrain tile, and `_setupProxiedCoordsForOrtho`
// collects every source tile overlapping that terrain tile, sorts them
// `b.overscaledZ - a.overscaledZ` — deepest first — and stencils them so the
// first one wins.
//
// Together: come back out to z13 and the stale z18 tile is drawn in place of the
// correct z15 one, squeezed to a quarter of its width. The ink goes to a
// hairline and the numbered shields shrink to dots, and it never recovers,
// because nothing ever releases those tiles. On the flat four the ideal tile is
// simply the one drawn, which is the whole of why this was a 3D-only bug.
//
// So: give every tile an end to its fade, one that has already passed. Nothing
// is ever "still fading", nothing holds its children, and the cache turns over
// as it does everywhere else. Measured over the same view before and after a
// zoom to maximum and back, the source cache goes from 156 tiles across four
// zooms to 40 across one, and the ink comes back to the pixel.
//
// **It writes a field that is Mapbox's, which wants justifying.** The honest
// alternative is a real `raster-fade-duration` over this basemap, and it was
// measured too: it restores the ink but leaves 130-odd stale tiles in the cache,
// so it treats the symptom and stays at the mercy of which tile happens to win.
// This removes the cause. `fadeEndTime` is read in two places and written in
// one, all of them shown above; if a future Mapbox renames it the `try` below
// means the overlay draws as it did before this fix rather than throwing on
// every frame — the bug comes back, and nothing else does.
//
// On `render` because that is the frame boundary the next `update` reads across,
// and only over terrain, because on the flat four there is nothing to fix.

/**
 * One route as a row: the sign, what it is called, and where it runs.
 *
 * **Three things and no labels.** This used to compose clauses — the kind, the
 * number, the itinerary, and the waymark as a sentence beginning "Waymark:" —
 * and a list of twenty routes made a wall of them, in which the one word you
 * were scanning for (the name) was the shortest thing on every line. Two of the
 * four are now redundant rather than dropped: the number is *painted on the
 * symbol*, which is the whole point of the symbol being a picture, and the kind
 * is what the main-routes switch above has already sorted on.
 *
 * Every string in here is an OSM tag value, which is to say something anyone on
 * the internet can edit — so the caller sets them with `textContent` and this
 * returns text rather than markup.
