// --- Which way the camera may point --------------------------------------------
// The map turns. It did not, for a long time, and the reason was never that
// anybody wanted a map you could only look at from the south: it was that every
// renderer here asks the same question — *what ground can the camera see* — and
// the only code that answered it read `map.getBounds()` and padded a north-up
// rectangle by a third. Turn the map and that rectangle is the wrong ground.
// src/view.js answers it from the camera instead, so this is now a switch
// rather than a rewrite.
//
// What a rotation costs: the smallest north-up box around a turned viewport is
// larger than the viewport — nothing at all at each quarter turn, and
// (W+H)²/2WH of it on the diagonal, which is exactly 2 for a square window and
// a little more the longer the window is. The blob sheet is painted into that
// box, so a map held on the diagonal pays about twice the pixels — bounded, as
// ever, by the caps in src/blob-canvas.js, which is why the worst case is a
// slightly softer wash rather than a slower one.
const ROTATE_ENABLED = true;

// ...and it leans. **Ctrl** (or the right button) and drag: sideways turns,
// up and down tilts, which is one gesture because they are one camera. Two
// fingers dragging vertically does the same on a touch screen. The compass that
// appears for a turn appears for a tilt too, and puts both back.
//
// Everything underneath it is the same machinery as the rotation: the blob
// sheet is a georeferenced quad, so it is drawn in perspective — and draped
// over terrain — by the same matrix that draws the basemap, and src/view.js
// computes the trapezoid of ground a leaning camera sees rather than pretending
// it is a rectangle.
//
// **60°, and the number is not a taste.** The horizon comes on screen when
// `cot(pitch) < tan(fov/2)`, which for the field of view both MapLibre and
// Mapbox ship is 71.6°. Below that there is ground everywhere the camera looks
// and nothing has to be invented to fill the top of the window; above it the
// map needs a sky, and a basemap that has not been given one draws its
// background colour up there instead. 60 keeps the horizon comfortably off
// screen at every zoom. `?pitch=` overrides it either way — `?pitch=0` for the
// old flat camera, `?pitch=80` to see what the sky would have to cover.
//
// What a lean costs is sharpness, not speed. The sheet is one flat raster over
// the whole visible ground, and the far edge of a perspective view is wider as
// well as further: measured, a 60° lean asks for **6.1× the ground** through
// the same window. The caps in blob-canvas.js then bind — `MAX_SIDE` even on
// Chrome, `JS_BLUR_MAX_PX` harder on WebKit — so the wash comes out about 1.7×
// softer there and 2.5× on WebKit, for exactly as long as the camera is tilted.
// Levelling restores the original sheet to the pixel; `coverageTooLoose` is
// what makes sure it actually does. The real fix is a tiled sheet rather than a
// viewport-sized one; see ARCHITECTURE.md.
// 60 on the four basemaps that have no sky. **85 on 3D, which has one** — and
// that is the whole of the difference. The rule above is not "60 is a good
// number", it is "do not let the horizon on screen unless something is drawing
// what is above it", and Standard draws a sky, a haze and a sun that moves with
// the light preset. Leaning past the horizon there is the view the basemap was
// made for; leaning past it on CARTO Dark fills the top of the window with
// #0e0e0e.
//
// What it costs is at the far edge, and it is the cost `PITCH_REACH` already
// bounds: past three screen heights the visited wash simply is not painted, so a
// hard lean shows the basemap running to its own horizon with no colour on it.
// That was true at 60 and is more visible at 85; it is not new, and the fix for

// How much of a wiggle is worth drawing, in screen pixels — the whole of the

//
// A recorded track is a sampled thing with a few metres of noise on every fix,
// so at anything below street zoom its vertices are a pixel apart and every
// other one doubles back. The core line is a hairline and nearly opaque, so it
// swallows that: overlapping opaque geometry looks like geometry. The glow is
// the same line up to *twenty pixels* wide and half transparent, and there each
// fold composites twice — a hard-edged wedge, brighter than either the glow or
// the line, in the shape of an arrowhead. It reads as a rendering fault in the
// track and is a property of the track.
//
// No `line-join` fixes it, and that is worth writing down because it looks like
// a join problem: `bevel` and `round` were both tried against it and both show
// the same shredded ribbon, because the overlap is between whole *segments*,
// not at the corner between two.
//
// Both libraries take this option in **screen pixels** and apply it per zoom
// (`_pixelsToTileUnits` in MapLibre, `EXTENT / tileSize` in Mapbox GL JS), which
// is exactly the shape of the problem: detail finer than a pixel or two is noise
// at every zoom, and zooming in brings the real shape back untouched. It has to
// live on the source rather than on the glow, so the crisp line and its halo are
// drawn from the same geometry — a glow simplified on its own would leave the
// line wandering outside its own halo at every switchback.
//
// The default is 0.375 px, which is fine for a drawn polygon and far too fine
// for a walked line.
const ROUTE_SIMPLIFY_PX = 2;
// How many rings the glow is made of — and the reason it is made of rings at
// all, which is worth writing down because two earlier attempts at the spikes
// were aimed at the wrong thing.
//
// **`line-blur` is not a blur.** Both libraries fade a line by taking the
// interpolated normal at each fragment and reading its *length* as a distance
// from the centre — `dist = length(v_normal) * v_width2.s` in the line fragment
// shader, character for character the same in Mapbox GL JS and in MapLibre.
// Across the quad of a straight segment that is exactly right. Across the
// triangles a **join** is built from it is not: the normal is interpolated along
// the chord rather than around the arc, so its length dips, the fragment
// believes it is nearer the centre than it really is, and the whole triangle
// paints at full strength with a straight, hard edge. That is the wedge — at
// every bend, in the colour the glow has at its core, bounded by the join
// triangle rather than by anything on the map.
//
// It is why `line-join: bevel` did not fix it — a bevel is still a triangle, and
// one big one instead of a fan of small ones — and why simplifying the track did
// not either: the bends are real corners of real roads, not noise on the fix.
// And it is why it was reported on the 3D basemap first. The wedge scales with
// the width, and the glow there is six times the core, ten times it on the route
// you have open.
//
// So the glow is drawn as **concentric rings with no blur at all**: the same
// line at a fraction of the width, at a fraction of the alpha, N of them
// stacking up towards the middle the way the gradient used to. Nothing is ever
// asked to compute a falloff, so there is nothing to get wrong at a corner.
// Eight is where the steps stop being visible as contours — four and six both
// read as a contour map of the route — and it is cheap for what it is: eight
// line layers over one source's buffers, against the 288 the railway overlay
// puts up without trouble.
//
// What this does *not* fix is the hairline where a track doubles back on itself
// and the ink lies over its own, which composites twice and always did. At a

// The last two are this app's, and the third state is only offered where a

// a halo around it — and with a colour per route, six of those bleeding into

//
// `line-occlusion-opacity` is Mapbox's answer — the opacity of the part of a
// line that is behind something — and it comes with a restriction that is easy
// to miss and silent when broken:
//
//   "The property is not supported when `line-opacity` has data-driven styling."

// and the same per-activity colour — colour may be data-driven, only opacity may
// not — at a flat opacity, with `line-occlusion-opacity: 1` so that the part
// behind a building is drawn at exactly the same strength as the part in front
// of one. On open ground the two crisp layers cover it and it is not visible as

// aim at.
//
// So a tap that lands on more than one asks instead of answering. A menu at the
// cursor, one row per activity with what it was called, when it was and how far,
// and the card opens on whichever you pick. **Hovering a row lights its line on
// the map**, which is what makes the list usable when six rows are the same
// word: it is the same feature state the pointer already writes, so the
// highlight costs nothing of ours (see setHoveredRoute).
//
// Shaped like the trails card next door — a list of named things the map is
// offering is one idea and should not look like two — and left open after a
// pick, because a stack is something you go through rather than choose from
// once.
//

// **The lines get a colour each while it is open.** Hovering answers "which one
// is this row", one at a time; a colour each answers "where does each of these
// go" all at once, which is the question you are actually holding when you tap a
// braid of eleven tracks. They come from a fifty-colour palette
// (src/route-colors.js), the same one the per-activity button hands out, and
// they last exactly as long as the card does.
//
// **Grouped by activity, newest first inside each.** A tap on a valley floor
// finds the ski runs, the walk up and the ride home, and those are three
// different questions wearing one stack. The groups are ordered by their newest
// member, so the outing you were most likely looking for leads.
//
// **Sideways where there is room.** On a desktop each activity is a column, so
// three activities are three lists side by side rather than one list you scroll
// through to find out there was a bike ride in it. On a phone, where the card is
// most of the screen's width, it stays a single column.

// overridden. The ladder would put the bottom of the country band at
// levelBoundary(7) ≈ 2.51, and the continent step under that below MapLibre's
// z2 tile boundary — a basemap serves *generalised* geometry at z1, far
// coarser than our own 1 km outlines. Our sharp fill over the basemap's blunt
// one shows as dark jagged rims all along every coast, and it is worst in the
// Arctic, where Mercator stretches the mismatch 4.8×. It cures itself the
// instant the zoom crosses 2.0 and the basemap sharpens, which is exactly how
// it was caught: two state dumps identical in every field but the zoom, one
// either side of the line.
//
// So the continent level takes its room out of the country band instead of out
// of the bottom of the map. Continents get (2, 2.75] and countries (2.75,

// OpenRailwayMap draws the sidings, yards and freight-only lines a basemap
// leaves out, and underneath CARTO's `rail` it was answering a question with the
// less detailed answer on top of it. It used to anchor to `tile-fill`, which put
// it under the visited wash as well.
//
// Not all the way up, though: it lands exactly where a saved route lands, and
// then under the routes themselves — a line you actually travelled beats
// reference geometry about where a line exists. `labelStart()` is the same
// anchor they use, so switching the overlay on cannot reorder anything relative
// to them; it only fills the gap directly beneath.
//
// Both therefore draw over the basemap's own labels, which on CARTO are all
// below this point. That is already true of every route on the map, and an
// overlay you switched on is meant to be the thing you are reading.

// installs last sits on top of the other, and `syncAirportLayer` runs after
// `syncRailLayer`. That is the right way round: an airport is one icon standing
// for a place, a railway is a network of lines, and a line drawn over a symbol
// is what makes the symbol unreadable rather than the other way about. Both

//
// That is the order these three want, and the reason is what each one is made
// of. This is a **sheet of pixels**: it covers what it is drawn over rather than
// threading between it, so an airport icon or a station symbol underneath it is
// simply gone. The other two are lines and symbols with transparent ground
// between them, and they lose nothing by being on top of a picture. Put the

// route, and it is a dot. A 7 px dot under a 12 px glow is a dot you cannot see

// ring — all of them ours, none of them something a photograph should cover.

// drawn over the marker you navigate by and over the ring around the cell you
// had just clicked.

  // the mesh. The texture is a fixed 1024×1024 — `Terrain.drapeBufferSize` is
  // `proxyTileSize * 2` and has **no devicePixelRatio in it** — while a proxy
  // tile covers 512 CSS px at an integer zoom and about 720 at a half one. On a
  // 2× display that is 1.00 texels per device pixel at best and 0.71 at worst,
  // and then it is resampled a second time onto the screen. A 3 px route came
  // out as 4 px of colour with a 2 px ramp either side, where the flat maps
  // give 6 px and a one-pixel edge.
  //
  // `line-elevation-reference` is the one thing that takes a line out of the
  // drape: the bucket becomes elevated, `isLayerDraped` answers false, and the
  // line is drawn to the screen as ordinary geometry at the full pixel ratio —
  // still following the ground, because that is what `ground` means. Measured
  // after: 6 px and a one-pixel edge, identical to the same map with no terrain
  // under it at all.
  //
  // **On a 1× display the drape is supersampled and there is nothing here to
  // fix**, which is why this survived being looked at more than once. Measured
  // in a default headless Chrome the two maps come out identical.
  //
  // **Only the core line, and the glow stays draped.** Two reasons, and the
  // second is the one that decided it. The glow is a halo — it is eight
  // translucent rings whose whole job is to be soft, and a sharper blur is not
  // a thing anybody can see. And an undraped translucent line shows its own
  // tile seams: Mapbox stencils a line against the overlap between its tiles
  // only when `line-opacity` is a constant other than 1, and `constantOr(1)` on
  // an expression answers 1 — so the glow, whose opacity is an expression
  // because hover and selection ride on it, gets no mask and composites twice
  // in the column where two tiles meet. Draped, the drape's own stencil covered
  // that. Undraped, it is a hairline of extra brightness across the halo at
  // every tile boundary, and it was plainly visible at 8×. The core line has
  // the same overlap and no visible seam, because 0.95 over 0.95 is 0.9975.
  //
  // Raising the drape buffer instead was tried and does not work: 2048² recovers
  // 7% of the 34% of edge energy the drape costs, and leaves the route's edge
  // exactly as it was — 4 px of colour, 2 px of ramp. What softens it is the
