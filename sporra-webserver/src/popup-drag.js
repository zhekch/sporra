// Moving a map card out of the way of the thing it is about.
//
// The `feature-popup` cards — the activity stack, the trails and the airports —
// are anchored to the point you tapped, and the point you
// tapped is usually the one you want to look at. A card listing eleven
// activities is most of the window, and every one of those eleven runs under
// it. The card is answering a question about a place while standing on it.
//
// So the heading is a handle: press it and the card goes where you put it.
//
// **The offset is the library's, not a transform of our own.** A popup is
// positioned by MapLibre and Mapbox on every frame of every pan, by writing a
// `transform` onto the container — so a translate of ours would be overwritten
// on the next frame, and holding it would mean fighting the renderer for the
// same property forty times a second. Both libraries already have the concept
// this needs: `Popup#setOffset` is a screen-space nudge that *they* compose
// into the transform they were going to write anyway. A drag is then a number
// they own, changed by us.
//
// **And a dragged card stops travelling with the ground.** That is the second
// half, and it is the half that took being used to notice. An undragged card
// belongs to its place and should ride with it: that is what makes it a popup
// rather than a dialog, and panning the map to see where the eleven activities
// actually go is exactly when you want the card pointing at them. But a card
// you have *moved* has been moved for a reason — it was covering something —
// and having it slide straight back over that something on the next pan is the
// drag being undone by the gesture it was making room for.
//
// So the first drag pins it. Not by taking it out of the popup, which would
// cost the close button, the close event that gives the route colours back, and
// the map's own habit of taking a popup away on the next click. The screen
// point is held instead, and the anchor is moved to wherever that point is now:
// `setLngLat(map.unproject(pinned))` on every `move`. The library goes on doing
// all of its own work, and the answer it computes happens not to change.
//
// The correction lands in the same event as the move that needed it — `move`
// fires, the popup's own handler positions it at the old anchor, ours runs
// after and `setLngLat` re-runs the same update synchronously — so the browser
// only ever paints the corrected position. Nothing flickers, and the anchor
// flip both libraries do when a point nears the edge of the window stops
// happening at all, because the point no longer moves.
