// The card you get by tapping a photograph on the map: when it was taken, and
// the photograph.
//
// Same glass and same language as the cell and route cards (src/cell-info.js,
// src/route-info.js), with one thing neither of them has to do — it fetches. A
// picture lives on the phone and crosses the bridge one at a time, so this card
// has states the others do not: waiting, arrived, and "that original is in
// iCloud and could not be had just now".
//
// It shows a **group** as readily as a single photo, because that is what a tap
// usually lands on: forty pictures of one dinner are one point on the map at
// every zoom there is. The strip along the bottom is the group, newest first,
// and picking one swaps the picture above it — so the card opens on the most
// recent, which for a place you have been back to is almost always the one you
// meant.
//
// ## The whole group, however big it is
//
// The strip used to stop at 48 and that was a card lying about what you had
// tapped. It now holds all of them, and pays for that in two ways rather than
// one, because a group of four thousand is two different problems:
//
// - **Elements.** Buttons are appended `STRIP_CHUNK` at a time, when a sentinel
//   at the end of the strip scrolls into view. Nothing below the fold exists.
// - **Requests.** A thumbnail is fetched when its button appears, not when it is
//   created. Scrolling the strip is what asks for pictures; a group you open and
//   glance at costs the dozen you can see.
//
// Both hang off one `IntersectionObserver` rooted on the strip, which is also
// what makes them stop: closing the card disconnects it, and whatever was
// queued simply never happens.

//
// The strip is a complete answer to "which one" and a poor answer to "the next

// along them with a thumb is not how anybody looks at photographs — you swipe,
// because that is what every other photograph on the device does.
//
// It is a *gesture*, not a pair of buttons that happen to be invisible: the
// picture follows the finger, resists at the ends of the group, and can be
// changed its mind about by putting it back. Nothing about that is decoration —
// a swipe that only reacts on release is one you cannot tell has been noticed,
// which is how you end up swiping twice and skipping one.

// pixel and then opens nothing is a broken tap.
const SWIPE_CLAIM = 10;

// A two-finger swipe on a trackpad is not a pointer gesture. It arrives as a
// stream of `wheel` events, which is why the swipe above worked on a phone and
// did nothing on a Mac — and why what it *did* do was worse than nothing: the
// strip is the only sideways scroller on the card, so the browser handed the
// swipe to that and one flick flew past thirty thumbnails without changing the
// picture at all.
//
// So the card takes the horizontal wheel itself, and answers it the way the Mac
// app answers the same gesture over its own gallery (`GalleryView.scrollWheel`
// in sporra-macos): accumulate, and step **once**.

// --- Where one swipe ends and the next begins -------------------------------------
//
// This is the whole difficulty, and the platform is no help: a `wheel` event
// does not say which part of a gesture it is. AppKit has `momentumPhase` and
// the web has nothing, so a firm flick and its second of coasting afterwards
// are the same stream of events — and counting the coasting is what turns one
// swipe into thirty.
//
// Spending the step once per gesture fixes that and introduces the opposite
// complaint, which is the one this is the second attempt at: if the *only* way
// to begin a new gesture is silence, then a second swipe made while the first
// is still coasting is swallowed, and the card feels as though it is on a
// cooldown. It was, effectively, for as long as the momentum lasted.
//
// So there are two ways back in, and the second is the useful one.

/** Silence. The fingers are up and the coasting has finished. */

 * swipe accelerates while the fingers are still on the glass, so the photograph
 * is spent a frame or two in and everything after it is faster than that. A
 * firm flick came out as three or four pictures.
 *
 * So the stream has to go quiet first. Below `WHEEL_LULL` it has wound down —
 * coasting decays towards nothing and cannot come back — and only then does
 * anything above `WHEEL_WAKE` mean a hand. Absolute rather than relative to the
