// The train-tracks overlay: OpenRailwayMap's own style, grafted onto whichever

//
// The overlay used to be one raster layer — `standard/{z}/{x}/{y}.png` from
// openrailwaymap.org, drawn at 85% opacity and switched on or off as a single
// thing. That is all a raster overlay can be: by the time the level crossings,
// the kilometre posts and the switch numbers arrive they are pixels, and
// nothing on this side can filter them, recolour them or say what one of them
// is. This module is the same content as vector tiles, which makes all three
// possible and costs a style of our own to carry.
//
// **The style is built, not fetched.** `scripts/build-rail-style.mjs` takes
// their published style apart and emits `rail-style.json`; read the note at the
// top of that file for what has to be rewritten and why. What arrives here is
// 288 layers that are ready to add except for two things only the running map
// knows — the basemap's fontstack, and which theme it is.
//
// **It is a dynamic import**, like the gazetteer and the boundaries: 315 KB that
// a session which never switches the overlay on should not pay for. The tiles
// behind it come from `/api/rail/*`, which is a caching proxy — see
// server/rail-tiles.js, and read its policy note before making the map ask for
// more than it does.

// The `sporra-orm-` namespace every id in the overlay carries is baked into
// rail-style.json by the build, not repeated here: one place decides it, and it
// is the place that writes the ids.
