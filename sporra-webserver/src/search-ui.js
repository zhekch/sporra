// ("was I ever in Trondheim?"), a route you remember by what it was called, and
// a trip you remember by *when* — which is the one a text field is worst at.
// Hence the calendar: dates are the one query people know exactly and type
// badly, and a month grid with the days you were somewhere already dotted
// answers "what was that weekend in August" without anyone typing anything.
//
// Everything here is local. Place names come from the dataset already shipped
// for naming routes (src/places.js), so a search never sends a keystroke or a
// coordinate anywhere.
