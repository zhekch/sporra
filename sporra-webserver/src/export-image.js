// The image export: your map as a picture you can put somewhere else.
//
// **It is not a screenshot, and that is the whole design.** A screenshot is the
// window you happened to have open — an aspect ratio decided by the browser, a
// frame decided by where you last dragged, and a basemap that is somebody
// else's tiles with somebody else's licence attached. What people actually want
// out of a map like this is a *portrait of a place*: Switzerland, cut out of the
// world, with the ground you have covered inside it and a line or two saying how
// much. So the export draws that from the same data the map draws from, on a 2D
// canvas of whatever size is asked for, and the boundaries the app already has
// are what cut the shape out.
//
// Which is also why there is no WebGL here. Reading pixels back out of the live
// map would need `preserveDrawingBuffer`, which costs every frame of every
// session for the sake of a button most people press twice — and it would still
// only ever hand back the window. Everything below is `CanvasRenderingContext2D`
// and arithmetic, so an export is the same picture on every machine, at any
// resolution, with no map instance involved.
//
// Four choices, in the order they are asked:
//
//   1. **Shape** — vertical, horizontal or square. Sets the canvas, and through
//      it the camera, the type scale and the blob level.
//   2. **What is in it** — any number of regions, countries or continents, or
//      everywhere. This is the *cut*: the selection's outline is the mask, and
//      nothing outside it is painted.
//   3. **Detail** — how the visited ground is generalised: blobs (the cells
//      themselves, poured together the way the map does it), or filled regions,
//      countries or continents. Deliberately separate from (2): "show me
//      Switzerland" and "colour it by canton" are different questions, and
//      answering them with one control is what makes a map lie.
//   4. **Colour by** — the same four modes the map has (src/coloring.js).
//
// …and then the caption, which is the reason the numbers below exist.
//
// Nothing here is cached: an export is a one-off, and a stale poster is worse
// than a slow one. What *is* avoided is recomputing between preview frames — see
// `coverageOf`, which the dialog holds on to while you drag a colour around.

// basemap. There is nothing behind the blob for it to dissolve into, so the

// more of the picture the smear eats.

//                       cell. 0.3–0.6 is what the map uses; 0.5 fades out over
//                       roughly half a cell. Raise for a softer edge.
//   BLOB_RIM_FEATHER_PX a last blur over the finished shape, in pixels of a

 * Ready-made palettes. Each is a complete answer — background, land, the line

 * machine for making an unreadable poster. Every one of them can still be
 * overridden.
 *
 * **The four under the wash are all quiet, and that is the constraint rather
 * than a taste.** The subject of the picture is the visited wash; anything under
 * it competing for the same attention turns the poster into two maps arguing. So
 * `background`, `land` and `edge` are each a near-neutral or a single
 * desaturated tone, and the distance between `background` and `land` is small —
 * enough to read as *there is ground there*, never enough to read as data.
 *
 * `accent` is the exception, and the reason the rest hold back. It is the only
 * saturated colour on the page, and it is chosen by three rules:
 *
 * - **Against the temperature of the ground.** Warm paper takes a cool or deep
 *   ink (Prussian blue on cream, verdigris on a sepia atlas); a cool or dark
 *   ground takes a warm luminous one (gold on navy, sand on cyanotype). The wash
 *   then separates by hue as well as by lightness, which is what stops it
 *   reading as a darker patch of land.
 * - **Past 3:1 against `land`.** The wash is a large shape rather than type, so
 *   that is the honest threshold; most are well past it. Pinned by
 *   `scripts/test/export-image.mjs`, because it is not visible from the hex.
 * - **One hue each.** Twelve looks that all resolved to gold would be one look.
 *
 * The other rule is that `land` is not always the lighter of the two. `chart`
 * inverts it deliberately, the way a sea chart does: pale water, paler land, and
 * the coastline legible because those two are close rather than because they are
 * far apart.
 *
 * Order is the order they appear in the dialog — the three that were here first,
 * then the lights, then the darks, then the one that is not a colour at all.

// "this whole corner of the country" at a glance. It is also the whole of what
// the picture says. Twenty-six cantons and one flat wash over eleven of them
// carry the same ink and the same amount of information.
//
// So the divisions are a strength of their own, the way *the rest of the world*
// and *their borders* are: the seams the infill is made of, drawn back over it.
// A third slider rather than a second colour, because how loud they should be
// depends entirely on the picture — a hairline that structures a country-sized
// fill turns a poster of one canton into a diagram of it.
//
// **Every unit the frame reaches, not only the lit ones.** The empty half of the
// subject is part of the composition too, and a picture where the lines stop
// where the colour stops draws attention to the boundary of your own travel
// twice over. The clip does the cutting, as it does for everything else here.
//
// **Which units is asked, not inherited.** These followed *Detail* on the
// grounds that they were the fill's own seams — which is one good picture and
// only one. A poster coloured by region wants the national borders in it as
// often as it wants the cantonal ones, and a poster coloured by country
// sometimes wants the regions showing through faintly underneath; neither was
// reachable while the lines were whatever the fill happened to be made of. So
// the selector says regions, countries, or both, and it means those words.
// Blobs are the exception: there is nothing between two blobs, so the row is
// hidden there rather than drawing something that answers a question nobody
// asked.
