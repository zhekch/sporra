// Turning the service worker on, and telling it when to forget things.
//
// The worker itself is `public/sw.js`, and everything about *what* it caches is
// explained there. This file is only the two decisions that belong to the page.
//
// **Production only.** A cache that answers before the server does is exactly
// what you want shipped and exactly what you do not want while editing: a stale
// shell served to a dev server you have just changed looks like a bug in the
// change. `npm run build && npm start` is where this is exercised, which is
// also where it matters. A worker left registered from an earlier production
// build on the same origin is actively unregistered in dev rather than merely
// not installed, because localhost is one origin and a laptop that once ran
// `npm start` would otherwise keep it forever.
//
// **iOS gets this for free.** The iOS app is a `WKWebView` with
// `websiteDataStore = .default()`, and WebKit has supported service workers in
// a web view since iOS 14 — registration, Cache Storage and all, persisted
// across launches by that store. So the app's shell, its 3 MB of gazetteer and
// its last view of the map are cached by the same code that does it in Safari,
// with nothing native to write and nothing bundled into the IPA. Bundling would
// have been the obvious alternative and is the worse one: a copy of the web app
// inside the app is a second copy that can disagree with the server's, which is
// the trade this whole project keeps refusing.

 * touches the account: cells, routes and preferences live on the server.
 *
 * It exists because a stale cache is invisible from the inside. Italy's region
 * boundaries were served `immutable` for a year under a URL that did not
 * mention which regions they were for, so when the dataset changed underneath,
 * browsers went on replaying the old answer through rebuilds, restarts and
 * reloads — and from the map it simply looked as though the app drew Italy
 * badly. The URL is keyed properly now, but any cache can go wrong in a way
 * that leaves no way to ask it to stop, and one button beats explaining
 * `caches.keys()` to someone.
 *
 * The service worker goes too, not just its caches: a worker from an older
 * build carries its own idea of what to serve, and unregistering it is the only
 * way to be sure the next load is the one on the server.
