// Which library draws the map, and why there are two of them.
//
// Three of the five basemaps are MapLibre's business and always will be: they
// are CARTO's and OpenFreeMap's tiles, MapLibre is BSD, and nothing about them
// wants anything else. Two more are Mapbox **imports** — Standard, and Standard
// Satellite — delivered as a style `import`, which is a Mapbox GL JS v3 feature
// MapLibre 5.24 does not implement. Handing that document to MapLibre yields a
// style with zero layers and a blank screen. Satellite without a token stays
// Esri's, which MapLibre draws; with a token it joins 3D on this side. There is
// no version of this where one library draws all five.
//
// So the engine is **decided at boot, from the chosen basemap** — and changed
// afterwards by rebuilding the map rather than by reloading the page. The
// reload was the first answer and it was too slow to live with: it threw away
// the session's cells, routes and boundaries and fetched them all again to
// change which library was drawing. `switchEngine()` in main.js does it
// properly, on the back of the `onMapBuilt` registry there.
//
// **Why not simply run Mapbox GL JS for everything** and delete this file: it is
// proprietary since v2, and it is billed *per map load* rather than per tile —
// so every time the app opened to look at CARTO Dark it would spend one of
// Mapbox's 50,000 monthly loads on a map Mapbox had nothing to do with. Loading
// it only when it is the thing being looked at keeps both the licence and the
// meter where they belong.
//
// Both libraries are imported dynamically, so a viewer who never chooses a
// Mapbox basemap never downloads Mapbox GL JS, and one who does never
// downloads MapLibre.

// nowhere else, so the state has to be read off the element and, in one case,
// written back to it. Mirroring the names onto the element was tried first and
// is worse in two ways that both bite: a `querySelector` running in the same
// tick as `addControl` would not see a mirror delivered by a MutationObserver,
// and `dropLockOnZoom` *removes* a state class, which a mirror would put
// straight back because the library's own copy of it is still there.

// built, `ctrlClass` names the library that is arriving while the DOM still
// belongs to the one that is leaving, and every selector built from it matches
// nothing.
//
// That window is exactly where the outgoing control's state has to be read, so

// --- Where our layers go ------------------------------------------------------
//
// Everything this app draws is inserted relative to the basemap: the visited
// wash goes under the streets and rooftops, and the railways, airports and
// photographs go under the labels. On MapLibre that is a `beforeId` — the id of
// a real layer, worked out by reading `map.getStyle().layers`.
//
// **On Standard there are no layers to read.** The style is one `import`, and
// `getStyle().layers` comes back empty, so there is no id to insert before.
// Standard answers this with **slots**: named places in the imported stack that
// a layer asks for by declaring `slot`. It is the better mechanism — it is a
// promise about position that survives Mapbox reordering the style underneath
// it, where a `beforeId` is a guess that a layer id still means what it meant.
//
// So the two anchors become sentinels, and `installAddLayerSlots` below teaches
// one `map.addLayer` to translate them. That is deliberately a wrapper rather
// than a change at the fourteen call sites in `main.js` and the three overlay
// modules: those all say `map.addLayer(spec, before)` today and go on saying it.

// MapLibre basemaps. `top` is above the buildings and the POI icons, which is
// where a photograph pin belongs.
//
// This was `middle` and that was wrong, in the way that is hard to see because
// nothing about it looks broken. `middle` is above the roads, so on the 3D
// basemap alone the wash was painted *over* the street network rather than under
// it: measured against Standard with no wash at all, `middle` left 11,852 of the
// frame's 21,695 strong edges — 45% of the map's detail gone — where `bottom`
// keeps every one of them. What it looked like was a flat field of colour with
// the roads as ghosts in it, and the routes on top reading as isolated bands
// rather than as lines over a map. That is the same fault CARTO Dark had for the
// opposite reason, and washAnchorIn()'s comment in src/basemap.js is written
// about it.
//
// `middle` is above the roads and **below the labels**, which is where a saved
// route has always been described as belonging: over the street network, under

//
// It needed a slot of its own only once the route line stopped being draped —
// see `groundLine` in src/main.js. A draped layer is drawn into the terrain's
// texture before anything undraped is drawn at all, so for as long as the route
// was draped it went under every label whatever slot it claimed, and `top` was

// taking it out of that protection: in `top` it came out over the street names,

// lying in the world, and wrong for an annotation drawn on top of it. The map's
// own labels never had the problem: `icon-` and `text-emissive-strength` default
// to 1, which is exactly the admission that some things are not lit by the scene.
//
// So ours say the same. Injected here rather than written into twenty layer
