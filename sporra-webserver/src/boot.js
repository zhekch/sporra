// The first thing the page runs, and the only thing it does is decide which map
// library to fetch before letting the app load.
//
// It exists for one reason. `main.js` builds its map at module scope, so the
// library has to be in hand before that module is *evaluated* — and the natural
// way to say that, a top-level `await` at the head of main.js, is not available
// here: the build targets Safari 14, which is the WebKit inside the iOS app, and
// top-level await arrived in Safari 15. Raising the floor to buy one `await`
// would drop the app off the phones it was written for.
//
// So the await happens here, in a module small enough that nothing depends on
// its ordering, and main.js is imported afterwards. It then reads `engineNow()`
// synchronously and cannot be wrong, because the only path to main.js runs
// through the line below.
//
// A failure is a browser that could not fetch Mapbox GL JS at all — an offline
// first load of the 3D basemap, most likely. MapLibre is loaded instead and
// main.js notices that it did not get the engine its basemap wanted, and moves
// the basemap rather than showing a background that never resolves.

// …and the same trick now carries a second passenger. `t()` in src/i18n.js is
// synchronous, because half the strings in this app are in module-level
// constants that are evaluated the moment their module is imported — so the
// language has to be in hand before anything below is. This is the one place
// that can wait for it, and it is already waiting.
import { MAPBOX, MAPLIBRE, engineForBasemap, loadEngine, savedStyleKey } from './gl-engine.js';
import { loadLocale } from './i18n.js';
import { capDevicePixelRatio } from './phone.js';

// Before either library is loaded, because Mapbox reads the ratio every time it
// sizes its canvas — see src/phone.js.
capDevicePixelRatio();

const wanted = engineForBasemap(savedStyleKey());

// The document is hidden until its stylesheet is — see the inline rule in the
// head of index.html. main.js imports the stylesheet before its own first line
// runs, so by the time that import resolves the page is styled and safe to
// show. Called on both paths: a page that could not load a map still has to be
// able to say so.
const reveal = () => document.documentElement.classList.remove('booting');

// Both at once: they need nothing from each other, and the language file is a
// few kilobytes against a map library's megabyte — waiting for it in series
// would add its round trip to every load for no reason.
Promise.all([
  loadEngine(wanted)
    .catch((e) => {
      if (wanted === MAPLIBRE) throw e; // nothing left to fall back to
      console.warn('Mapbox GL JS could not be loaded; falling back to MapLibre.', e);
      return loadEngine(MAPLIBRE);
    }),
  // Never rejects — a language that will not load falls back to English inside
  // `loadLocale`, because a page in the wrong language beats no page at all.

/**
 * Say what went wrong, in a way that survives the thing that went wrong.
 *
 * Anything awaited above can be missing: a map library, the language file, and
 * — since `main.js` imports it — **the stylesheet**. That last one is what made
 * the previous version of this handler useless. It wrote its sentence into
 * `#map` and trusted the page's own CSS to make it legible, so on the one load
 * where the CSS was the casualty it drew default black text on an unstyled
 * page. In a browser that is ugly. In the iOS app, where the web view is
 * transparent over a near-black background, it is invisible: a phone in
 * airplane mode showed an empty grey rectangle, scrollable, with this message
 * on it the whole time.
 *
 * So every rule here is inline, and it says which piece was missing. That
 * detail is the difference between "it is broken" and "it is offline and the
 * offline copy has a hole in it", and only one of those tells you to reconnect
 * once and open it again.
