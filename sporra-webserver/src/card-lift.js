// Lifting the map's own controls over whatever card is open.
//
// On a phone an info card is a sheet across the bottom of the screen, and the
// button cluster — search, the layers menu, "my location" — sits in the corner
// underneath it. Tap a cell and those three are behind the card: still there,
// still tappable in the few pixels that stick out, and to anyone using it they
// have simply gone. So while a card is open they step above it.
//
// **The distance cannot be a constant.** A cell card is a title and five rows; a
// route card is a title, six rows and three buttons; a photo card is a
// photograph, and a photograph's card *changes height while you are looking at
// it* — the figure is 116 px of waiting panel until the picture arrives and then
// takes the shape of the picture. A hardcoded offset would be wrong for two of
// the three cards and wrong twice for the third.
//
// So it is measured, and re-measured, and published as `--card-h` for the
// stylesheet to read. The lifting itself is CSS, in the phone media query, where
// the problem exists.
//
// Nothing calls this per card. There are a dozen places that open or close one —
// `showCellInfoAt`, `closeRouteInfo`, the mode switch, signing out — and a
// notification hooked into each of them is a notification somebody forgets to
// add to the thirteenth. Watching the cards themselves cannot drift.

/** The cards that dock at the bottom. All are `.cell-info` in the markup; the ids
 *  are the list. The last is the pile of activities, which is a card here only on
 *  a phone — on a desktop that element is never shown, and measures 0. */
