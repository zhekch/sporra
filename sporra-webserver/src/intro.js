// The first five minutes: what this is, and what to feed it.
//
// A map with nothing on it is the one screen in this app that cannot explain
// itself. Every other empty state has a heading above it saying what would be
// there — no routes yet, no trips yet — but the map's empty state *is the
// product*, a grey world you are apparently meant to know what to do with. The
// question people actually arrive with is not "how do I use this", it is "what
// is this for, and where does the data come from", and neither is answerable
// from a grid of hexagons.
//
// So it is answered once, in front of the map, and then never again.
//
// ## Why the arithmetic is in here and the cards are not
//
// The same split as `src/whats-new.js` and its `-ui`: everything that is a
// *decision* — whether to show it at all, which permissions this host can even
// offer, which of them are already answered, what the closing numbers say — is
// here, where it can be tested without a browser. `src/intro-ui.js` owns the
// deck, the swipe and the confetti, none of which a test can meaningfully
// assert about.
//
// ## It is not a tour
//
// Nothing here points at a button and says "this is the menu". Interface tours
// are read once and forgotten, and this interface is a map — you already know
// how a map works. What is worth saying is the part no amount of poking will
// tell you: that a *trip* is a derived thing with a definition, that workouts
// come from four different places, that the server this is talking to is yours.
// Five cards of that, and then it gets out of the way.

 *     one: it is the permission having already produced the thing it was for.
 *
 * Two of them can also be asked outright, and are:
 *
 *   - **location**, of the Permissions API, which is the only real answer
 *     available anywhere here. The remembered copy is the fallback for browsers
 *     that do not implement it.
 *   - **health**, of the iPhone app, which knows whether its own workout sync
 *     is switched on. That is a stronger signal than a source on the map,
