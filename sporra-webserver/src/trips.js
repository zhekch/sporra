// it is the thing that makes a map browsable by what you remember rather than
// by which file it came out of.
//
// Nothing new is stored for this. Every trip below is worked out from dates and
// positions the cells and routes already carry, which means it costs no import
// path, no schema and no migration, and it re-derives itself the moment new
// history arrives. The price is that a trip cannot be renamed — it isn't a row,
// it's a reading of the rows — and that a trip only knows about days the data
// knows about. A week in a country with your phone off is a week that didn't
// happen, which is the same honesty the rest of the map keeps.

 * the region's visits, which was the best the data supported before a spot knew
 * when it was reached — and it has a floor of one whole day under every place a
 * trip touched at all. Within a single day that floor is the entire measure:
 * every candidate scores 1.0-something, differences of 3× in the actual time
 * spent compress into differences of 15%, and the population factor decides
 * everything.
 *
 * That is how a day trip to a village came out named after the town it drove
 * through on the way: five cells' worth of motorway in a place of 35,000 beat
 * four hours in a place of 11,000, because the four hours were worth 0.27 and
 * being three times larger was worth 1.23.
 *
 * Seconds have the range the question needs. A week somewhere is ~40× a
 * four-hour stop, so days still dominate whenever days differ — which is what
 * the old measure was really trying to say.
 *
 * Square-rooted, because raw seconds have *too much* range for the other half
 * of the question. Size is supposed to break near-ties — nobody calls a week in
 * Lisbon "Lumiar" after the parish they happened to sleep in — and against
 * unbounded time it never could: the place you sleep always holds more hours
 * than the place you go. The root leaves a 5× difference in time worth 2.2×,
 * enough to beat any size gap that matters, while a 1.5× difference is worth
 * 1.2× and loses to a city ten times the size. Both of those are real cases:
 * four hours in St. Moritz against minutes in Chur, and eight nights in a
 * Lisbon parish against eight days in Lisbon.
