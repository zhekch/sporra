// Mapbox Standard: the token it needs, and the two knobs it has.
//
// This is the fifth basemap — 3D buildings, modelled landmarks, trees you can
// see the shape of, and a sun that can be put in four places or left to follow
// the one outside the viewer's own window. It is drawn by Mapbox GL JS rather
// than by MapLibre; `src/gl-engine.js` is where that decision lives and why.
//
// **What this file used to be.** The first version of the 3D basemap ran on
// MapLibre, because keeping one engine was worth a lot: it fetched
// `mapbox/streets-v12` — a classic, flat, spec-v8 style MapLibre renders fine —
// rewrote every `mapbox://` URL in it to https, extruded the `building` layer
// itself with a `fill-extrusion`, bolted on a `raster-dem` for terrain and a sky
// above it, and put the token on each request through a `transformRequest`. It
// worked, and Mapbox even documents that path. It is gone because it could only
// ever be an imitation: the trees, the landmark models and the light presets are
// not layers in a style you can borrow, they are Standard, and Standard is a
// style *import*, which is a Mapbox GL JS feature. Rebuilding it by hand meant
// maintaining a worse copy of a thing that already exists. Anything that needs
// it is in git before this commit.
//
// What survived is the part that was never about rendering: whose token this is,
// and how to tell somebody it does not work.
//
// **The token is the viewer's own, and it follows their account.** Mapbox serves
// nothing without an account, this app has never had one, and it is not going to
// bill somebody else's tiles to it.
//
// It lived in localStorage and nowhere else for as long as the 3D basemap has
// existed, on the argument that a credential belonging to somebody else's
// account should never touch our server. That turned out to be the wrong trade
// for the only person it affects: it meant pasting the same token again on the
// phone, again on the laptop, and again after every cache clear, to switch on a
// basemap they had already signed up for. So it is a preference like any other
// now — put into the account's blob by main.js and adopted from it by every
// device that signs in. `src/prefs.js` holds the one rule that is not obvious.
//
// What that costs is worth stating plainly, because the dialog used to promise
// the opposite: the token sits in the `user_prefs` row in plain text and rides
// along in every backup file the server takes. For a **public** token (`pk.`)
// that is a fair price — it is designed to sit in a web page, it is already in
// the query string of every tile this browser fetches, and anyone who can read
// that database can read the map it draws. A **secret** token (`sk.`) is a
// different object entirely, which is why `tokenComplaint` still refuses one by
// name and why it matters more now than it did.
//
// localStorage stays, as the device's copy rather than the only one. Two things
// need it: the map is built before the session is resolved — `boot.js` picks a
// map library from `hasMapboxToken()` synchronously, long before `/api/prefs`
// has answered anything — and the basemap has to keep working offline.

//
//     ["interpolate", ["linear"], ["zoom"], 6, 0, 7, 1, 12, 1, 13.7, 0]
//
// — relief through the zooms where you are looking at a region, and **faded back
// to flat by z13.7**, which is every zoom at which you are looking at a city. In
// Bern that is the difference between a town on the side of a gorge and a town
// printed on a sheet of paper: the Aare drops forty metres below the Bundesplatz
// and none of it was there. This file briefly deferred to that ramp and the map
// lost the thing that made it worth looking at.
//
// **What it costs is bridges, and there is no way to have both.** Terrain drapes
// line layers onto the DEM, so the Kornhausbrücke — which Standard otherwise
// models as a deck forty metres above the water — sinks to river level and
// crosses the Aare as a painted stripe. That is what draping *is* for a line
// layer; all 45 of Standard's config options were read looking for an exemption
// and there is none. Checked both ways over that bridge, twice.
//
// So it is a trade, and this is the side of it worth being on: the relief is
// everywhere and all the time, and the flattened bridge is a handful of spans in
// a city. Set this to 0 for the other side — bridges with decks, and a flat

// not Standard has no such import.
//

// underneath them. Without them the icons keep their colour and their meaning
// and stop reading as a scatter of buttons.

// the words that were the noise.
const SHOW_TRANSIT_LABELS = false;

// --- The 3D work, and the thing that was never wrong with it --------------------
//
// **None of this is what made a landmark look like a shed.** That was the
// server's `script-src`, which had no wasm source and so blocked the WebAssembly
// Mapbox GL JS decodes the batched landmark meshes with — see the CSP note in
// server/index.js. Every property below was read carefully, twice, while the
// actual bug sat one directive away in another file and could not be seen from
// here at all, because Vite's dev server sends no CSP and so the map on
// localhost:5173 was perfect the entire time.
//
// The lesson worth keeping is about *where to look*, not about config: a feature
// that draws nothing has a renderer between it and the screen, and the renderer
// is running inside somebody's policy. Ask what the deployed page is allowed to
// do before re-reading what the style was asked to draw.
//
// **Facades** are the intricate buildings — modelled windows, walls, roofs,
// entrance lights — and Mapbox's own words for switching them on are "must be
// toggled on in Studio or enabled directly in the code using the
// `show3dFacades` property". They exist in a *list of cities* rather than
// everywhere: Munich, Berlin, Stuttgart, San Francisco, New York, Las Vegas,
// Helsinki and Tokyo at the time of writing, more through 2026. So this changes
// nothing at all in Bern, and it is still right — the map is not a map of Bern,
// and the alternative is finding out in Tokyo that the setting existed all along.

// answer before this file ever had an opinion about it.
//
// They were switched on as a guess at the missing models and are exactly the
// wrong thing: an icon *in place of* a landmark is a worse map than the plain
// extrusion it sits on, because it covers the building with a claim that there
// is something here worth seeing and then declines to show it. With the CSP
// fixed the model itself draws, and a marker for a thing already on the screen
// is one more sticker over the ground this map is about — the same call as the
// POI discs above, and made for the same reason.
//
// The icons also cost requests that answer 404: `mapbox-landmark-pois-v1` is not
// served to this account's token, so every tile of it was a round trip to a
// refusal for a layer nobody asked for.
const SHOW_LANDMARK_ICONS = false;

// **The models themselves, from the zoom the rest of the city arrives at.**
//
// Standard publishes `building-models` at **minzoom 14** and every other
// building layer at **15**: `3d-building`, `2d-building`, `procedural-buildings`
// and `building-underground` all start together, one zoom later. So there is a
// band between them where the modelled landmarks stand on a city that has no
// buildings in it — a parliament and a cathedral floating over a bare street
// plan, which reads as something half-loaded rather than as detail. Zooming in
// then makes the rest of the city appear *around* models that were already
// there, which is backwards: the landmark is what you should arrive at last.
//
// **The layer's own minzoom cannot be moved from out here.** `setLayerZoomRange`
// resolves against the style's own layers and returns without a word for one
// that arrived inside an import — the same silence `setConfigProperty` has for a
// name it does not know. Neither the plain id nor any scoped spelling reaches
// it.
//
// So the zoom is answered by *setting the config property again*, from a `zoom`
// handler, which is the plain thing and the only one that works.
//
// **What does not work, tried and measured: putting an expression in the config
// value.** `["step", ["zoom"], false, 15, true]` is accepted by
// `setConfigProperty`, reads back intact from `getConfigProperty`, and is wrong
// — Standard gates the layer through `layout.visibility`, which is resolved when
// the style is evaluated and *not* re-resolved as the camera moves. So the value
// is read once, at whatever zoom the page happened to load at, and frozen: open
// the map at z10 and the landmarks never appear at any zoom, because the answer
// was computed while they were legitimately hidden. It looks exactly like the
// CSP bug it was written on top of — a plain extrusion, no error — which is how
// it survived being "verified" by flipping it at one zoom and looking.
