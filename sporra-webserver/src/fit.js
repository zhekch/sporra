// Garmin FIT, read-only, and only as far as the map needs: where you were and
// when. Most Strava activities come out of the bulk export as .fit — that is
// what the phone app and every bike computer upload — so without this the
// archive import would miss the majority of a history.
//
// FIT is binary and self-describing: the file carries its own schema. A
// *definition* message says "local type 3 means global message 20, and its
// fields are, in this order, a 4-byte uint32 numbered 253 and two 4-byte
// sint32s numbered 0 and 1"; every *data* message tagged local type 3 after it
// is then only those bytes back to back, carrying no field numbers of its own.
// So the stream has to be walked from the front: you cannot seek to the
// records, and one definition you failed to read leaves you unable to size
// every data message after it.
//
// We want global message 20 (`record`) — field 0 position_lat, field 1
// position_long, field 2 altitude (or field 78, the enhanced one), field 253
// timestamp — plus the sport, if the file names it. Power, heart rate, laps
// and everything else are stepped over by their declared width without being
// decoded.
//
// Nothing here verifies a CRC, neither the header's nor the file's. A FIT that
// is actually damaged trips over its own structure long before the checksum
// would catch it, and throwing away an otherwise readable ride because two
// trailing bytes are stale is the worse outcome.

// degrees = semicircles * 180 / 2^31. Positions are int32 semicircles, which is
// why an "invalid" one has to be caught by its sentinel rather than by a range
// check: 0x7FFFFFFF is a hair under +180°, a perfectly plausible longitude.
