// loose enough to catch two genuinely different outings.

//
// Some formats say where those breaks are: a GPX puts each in its own `<trkseg>`,
// TCX has laps, KML has separate coordinate blocks. The ones that arrive over an
// API do not. Strava hands back one flat stream of points however many times you
// stopped, Komoot the same, and an Apple Health route is a single series across
// every pause in the workout. Those three used to be drawn straight across.
//
// So the rule lives here, applied to every track from every source on its way in,
// rather than three times in three parsers with three sets of numbers.
//
// **It takes two measurements to call something a pause**, and that is the whole
// subtlety. Time alone is wrong: standing still legitimately produces one long

// Most files say what they were: GPX has <type>, TCX a Sport attribute, FIT a
// sport message, and Komoot and Strava both label their own. When none of them
// does, the track can usually still be worked out without anyone typing it in.
//
// Two signals, in order of how much they can be trusted:
//
//  1. The name. Apps write what they were into it — Slopes calls every export
//     "Slopes - A day skiing at …", and a file someone named "Hike" is a hike.
//     This goes first because it is the only thing that identifies a sport
//     speed cannot: a day on the pistes averages ~10 km/h, which is squarely
//     the pace of a run, and guessing from the number alone got both of the
//     real ski days in the author's own map wrong.
//  2. Failing that, the average pace, in deliberately wide bands.
//
// It is still a guess and is stored as one (`sportGuessed`), so the dialog can
// say so and a label from a file always wins. The uncertain middle is left
// blank rather than filled in with a coin toss: "" is a better answer than a
// confident wrong one.
