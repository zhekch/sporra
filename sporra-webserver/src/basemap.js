//             rgb(32,32,32), water rgb(27,27,29) with the blue channel two
//             points above the others. That is the look this exists to get

//             desaturated grey-green, forest becomes green and starts drawing
//             at z4 instead of z10, water becomes properly blue, roads become

//             switched on underneath at low zoom.

// every lane in a canton on screen while you are looking at a country.
//
// Light (CARTO Voyager) is the one that reads cleanly, and it is disciplined

// z4 by rank, road names from z13, minor roads from z13. These are those gates,
