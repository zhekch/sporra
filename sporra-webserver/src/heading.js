// Which way you are facing, as a beam out of the blue dot.
//
// The dot says where you are and nothing else, which is half of what a map is
// asked while you are standing in the street holding it. The other half is
// *which way am I pointing* — the thing every phone map answers with a cone of
// light out of the dot, and the reason people turn on the spot with a phone in
// their hand rather than reading the street names.
//
// **It is a phone feature because it is a magnetometer feature.** Nothing here
// asks what kind of device this is: a heading is taken only from a reading that
// says it is absolute — `webkitCompassHeading` on iOS, `absolute === true`
// everywhere else — and a laptop has no compass to produce one with. So the beam
// appears on the devices that can honestly draw it and is silently absent on the
// rest, with no user-agent test anywhere and nothing to keep in step with the
// next generation of hardware.
//
// **Mapbox GL JS has `showUserHeading` and MapLibre has nothing at all**, so
// neither library's version is usable here: this app switches between the two
// while it is running (see src/gl-engine.js), and a beam that exists on one
// library and not the other is worse than no beam. What follows is one
// implementation driven onto whichever control is live, the same way
// src/glide.js drives one dot-smoother onto both.
//
// The shape itself is CSS — `.sporra-user-heading` in src/style.css. This file
// decides where it points.
//
// It also turns the map, on request. That is the third state of the locate
// button — see `setHeadingUp` at the bottom, and "The button that says where you
// are" in ARCHITECTURE.md.

// --- Tuning -------------------------------------------------------------------

// How quickly the beam catches up with the compass, as the time constant of an
// exponential ease: after `HEADING_TAU_MS` it has closed about 63% of the turn.
//
// A compass is *noisy* in a way GPS is not. A phone lying still reports a
// heading that wanders a couple of degrees at 60 Hz, and pointing a 90 px beam
// straight at each reading makes it shiver — the one thing that reads as
// "broken" rather than "imprecise". Low-passing it costs a fraction of a second
// of lag on a real turn, which nobody can see, and removes all of the shiver,
// which everybody can.
//
// Exponential rather than the linear glide the dot gets, and the difference is
// the input. A position arrives once a second and the honest thing to do
// between two of them is walk the line. A heading arrives sixty times a second
// and is *already* a stream — there is nothing to interpolate across, only
// noise to reject — so this is a filter, not an interpolation.
const HEADING_TAU_MS = 120;

// A new reading has to differ from the one being aimed at by this much before it
// is aimed at instead. Purely so that a phone on a table stops booking animation
// frames: under the threshold the reading is noise, and the beam is already
// pointing where it says.
const HEADING_STEP_DEG = 1;

// …and the beam stops when it is this close, rather than approaching forever.
// An exponential ease never arrives, and a marker that re-projects itself on
// every frame for the last quarter of a degree is a frame budget spent on
// nothing.

// --- Turning the map with you -------------------------------------------------
//
// How often the camera may be re-aimed while the map is following your heading,
// and what has to have changed for it to be worth doing.
//
// **These are a budget on `moveend`, not on smoothness.** The rotation itself is
// smooth whatever these say, because each re-aim is an `easeTo` that animates
// for exactly the interval until the next one — so the camera is always moving
// and never steps. What the interval buys is that the app's own settle work
// (`askChromeAgain`, `refreshSnow`, `updateTiles` — all hung off `moveend` in
// src/main.js) runs a handful of times a second rather than sixty. Driving the
// camera per frame was the first version and it was wrong twice over: `setBearing`
// is a `jumpTo`, which *stops* whatever animation is running, so it also cancelled
// the dot's own camera follow sixty times a second.
//
// A quarter of a second is under the threshold at which a rotation reads as
// lagging, and two degrees is above the noise the low-pass leaves behind — so a
// phone held still re-aims not at all, a walk re-aims when the dot drifts, and
// only an actual turn spends the full budget, for the second or two it lasts.

 * to wherever it happened to be when the page loaded.
 *
 * **iOS is the special case and it is the good one.** WebKit exposes
 * `webkitCompassHeading`, which is CoreLocation's true-north heading — already a
 * bearing, already corrected for magnetic declination, and alongside a
 * `webkitCompassAccuracy` that goes *negative* to say the reading means nothing
 * (a magnetometer still settling, or a phone that has just been next to a
 * speaker magnet). That is the one signal here that can say "I do not know", and
 * ignoring it would point the beam confidently at a wrong street.
 *
 * Everywhere else the reading is `alpha`, which is a rotation about the vertical
 * axis measured **anticlockwise** from north — so a bearing is its negation.
 * `absolute` is what says north is involved at all, and it is not optional:
 * plain `deviceorientation` on most hardware reports alpha relative to the
 * device's orientation at page load, which is a number that looks exactly like a
 * heading and points nowhere. Where the reading is absolute it is generally
 * *magnetic* north rather than true north, a few degrees out in most of the
 * world; that is smaller than the beam is wide and there is nothing here that
 * could correct it.
 *
 * Note `Number.isFinite` rather than a truth test on `webkitCompassHeading`,
 * which is what Mapbox GL JS's own version does: a heading of exactly 0 is due
 * north, and treating it as absent falls through to the alpha branch and reports
 * whichever way the phone was pointing when the tab opened.
