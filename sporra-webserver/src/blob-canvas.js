// Blob rendering.
//
// Visited cells are hexagons in storage, but nobody wants to look at a
// honeycomb. Each lit cell is painted into an offscreen canvas and the whole
// sheet is then blurred, which does two things at once: the hexagon edges
// dissolve into an organic silhouette, and neighbouring cells of different
// colors bleed into each other so a heat map reads as a continuous field
// instead of a mosaic. A few alpha passes over the blurred sheet firm the rim
// back up — the classic "metaball" trick — so blobs still have a defined edge.
//
// The result is handed to MapLibre as a canvas source pinned to a rectangle of
// *ground* — four lng/lat corners — rather than to the window. That is what
// lets the map be turned: the sheet is drawn by the same matrix as the basemap,
// so it rotates, foreshortens under a pitch and drapes over terrain without
// anything here knowing that any of those happened.
//
// What the camera does decide is which rectangle to ask for, and that arrives
// as an argument (`bb`). src/view.js works it out from the camera — bearing and
// pitch included — and a still image being exported answers it for itself. The
// pipeline below has never known which of the two it is drawing for.

// Canvas pixels per CSS pixel. Well below 1 because everything here is about
// to be blurred and re-cut: the softness hides the lower resolution, and the
// smoothing rounds read every pixel back, so pixel count is the main cost of a
// repaint.
const QUALITY = 0.3;
// ...but a CSS pixel is not a screen pixel. Measured per CSS pixel alone, the
// sheet came out ~6× smaller than the display on a normal retina laptop and ~9×
// on a phone, and stretching it that far turns every soft edge into visible
// stair-steps — which is what made the map look coarse on mobile and fine on a
// non-retina monitor. Scaling by the device ratio keeps the same apparent
// sharpness on every screen instead of quietly depending on the hardware.
//
// Capped at 3 so a very high-density display doesn't quadruple the work for a
// difference nobody can see through the blur; MAX_SIDE still bounds the rest.
// Where the blur has to run in JS, every extra pixel is paid for six times over
// (three box passes, two directions), so the density is followed only part of
// the way: measured, a full dpr-3 sheet costs ~110 ms per repaint on a fast
// desktop and perhaps three times that on the phone that would be asking for
// it. 1.5 keeps the sheet noticeably sharper than it was while staying inside a
// moveend's budget.

// which is the number a desktop window changes. Measured in a WKWebView on a
// retina Mac, where `nativeBlur()` is false (WebKit has no canvas `filter` at
// all — `'filter' in CanvasRenderingContext2D.prototype` is false, so the
// property assignment in `blurInto` is an ordinary JS property that blurs
// nothing, which is exactly what the probe above exists to catch):
//
//   iPhone-sized sheet   246×532 = 131k px   ~9 ms per repaint
//   1440×900 window      907×567 = 514k px  ~35 ms per repaint
//
// Same code, same density, four times the work — purely because the window is
// bigger. That is the whole of why zooming feels fine on the phone and in
// Chrome (which has a native blur and never takes this path) and drags on a
// Mac: a level change pays that cost, and the crossfade that follows it
// recomposites a canvas of the same size on every frame.
//
// 300k is ~20 ms of blur at the worst case and never binds below roughly a
// 1100×700 window, so a phone is untouched and a small window is untouched;
// only a large one gives up density it was only spending on a sheet that is
// about to be blurred anyway. Raising it trades smoothness for sharpness on
// big screens; the honest fix is a blur that is not in JavaScript.
//
// Deliberately not applied when the blur is native: there an extra pixel costs
// one GPU pass rather than six CPU ones, and the image export wants every pixel

// recomposites a sheet of this size on every frame of a 620 ms crossfade, while
// the map is still rendering the basemap under a moving camera.
//
// So the gesture gets a smaller sheet: measured in a WKWebView, 300k px is a
// 23 ms paint and 120k is 9 ms, and every frame of the crossfade that follows
// carries the same ratio through the canvas composite and the texture upload.
// Nothing is given up permanently — main.js repaints at the full budget once the
// camera has settled and the dissolve has landed, and until then the difference

export const BLOB_LEVEL = 0.4;
// --- Edge softness ------------------------------------------------------------
// Two knobs, and the single-color and heat maps get their own of each, because
// the edge is doing a different job in the two modes. A flat wash is a hint you
// read the map through, so it can dissolve as gently as you like. A heat map is
// the data itself: every pixel of ramp is also a fade toward transparent, so a
// wide edge makes the outermost cells read as a *lower value* than they hold,
// and the softer the rim the more of the mosaic it eats.
//
// Both pairs start at the same value, so changing nothing changes nothing.
//
// 1. BLOB_EDGE — width of the alpha ramp on the final cut, in units of a cell:
//    0.05 is a crisp edge, 0.5 fades out over roughly one cell. Capped
//    internally so the ramp can never reach alpha 0 (that would tint the whole
//    canvas and draw its rectangular edge across the map), so it is safe to
//    turn all the way up. Scales with cell size, so it holds its shape relative
//    to the blobs at every level.
//
//    The heat maps get the *tighter* of the two, which is what the reasoning
//    above always said and what the code did not do: they shipped at 0.6
//    against the wash's 0.3, and 0.6 is wide enough to stop being a cut at all.
//    The band runs from `BLOB_LEVEL - edge` to `BLOB_LEVEL + edge`, so 0.6
//    against a level of 0.3 clamps to [ALPHA_FLOOR, 0.9] — very nearly the
//    whole alpha range, mapped almost linearly. Nothing was firmed up: a pixel
//    came out roughly as opaque as the blur left it, and the blur only leaves
//    full alpha in the middle of something large. Measured, that is what made
//    Type and Most-visited look like fog — a seven-cell cluster peaked at 0.25
//    alpha where the same cluster in the wash peaked at 1.00, purely because
//    the wash still had a cut and the heat maps had given theirs away.
export const BLOB_EDGE = 0.3; // single color
export const BLOB_HEAT_EDGE = 0.2; // visits / recent / first seen
// The band used by the shaping rounds — deliberately tight, see the loop in
// paint(). Not a look knob.
const SHAPE_EDGE = 0.1;
// 2. BLOB_FEATHER_PX — final feather in CSS pixels, applied once the shape is
//    settled. Everything else here works in units of a cell, and a cell's
//    on-screen size swings 3× within a zoom level — which is why edges look
//    soft zoomed in and hard zoomed out. This last blur is measured in screen
//    pixels instead, so the fade from color to map is the same width at every
//    zoom. Nothing is re-cut afterwards, so the tail keeps its true colors and
//    simply runs out.
//
//    Same correction, and it mattered more than the edge did. A cell's radius on
//    screen is between 2.2 and 6.7 CSS pixels at every level — that is what the
//    zoom ladder is *for* — so a five-pixel feather was wider than the cell it
//    was feathering, and it ran after the last cut with nothing to re-firm it.
//    A heat map is the data itself; blurring it by a cell and a half is not a
//    soft edge, it is a lower reading. One pixel, like the wash: the rim is
//    already as gradual as BLOB_HEAT_EDGE makes it.

// above that, or diagonal neighbours pinch into a string of beads instead of
// flowing into one ribbon.

// --- Cells with nothing around them ---------------------------------------------

// the blur, and with the blur at a whole cell radius a disc of 0.9·R peaked at

// that reason. What is left is `SPARSE_MIN_PX`, for a sheet where a cell is
// barely a pixel and the rasterizer would hand the cut a fraction of full
