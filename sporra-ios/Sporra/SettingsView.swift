/// Almost everything about your *map* — importing, syncing, backups, colours,
/// home, statistics — lives in the web app's own menu, where it already works
/// and where a laptop finds it in the same place. Duplicating any of it here
/// would mean two screens that have to agree.
///
/// What is left is the handful of things only this app can answer: which server
/// to open, how this phone records where it has been, and how to forget both.
///
/// The middle one is the exception that proves the rule. It looks like a sync
/// setting and by rights belongs on the sync screen with Home Assistant and
/// Strava — except that a schedule stored on the server could not wake a
/// sleeping phone, so the timer runs here or it does not run. What the server
/// *does* keep is the result: open the site on a laptop and this phone is listed
/// under Import & sync with what it has sent and when it last spoke.
///
/// Presented as a sheet over the map, from Personal ▸ App settings on the site
/// — or from the setup card, before there is a site to put that row on. See
/// ``SettingsBridge``.
