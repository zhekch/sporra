/// What the web app asks when it wants your workouts.
///
/// The introduction (`src/intro-ui.js`) offers three permissions on a first run,
/// and two of them could already be asked for from the page: a photo library is
/// asked by *asking it a question* — see ``PhotoBridge`` — and a position by the
/// ordinary `navigator.geolocation`. Health was the odd one out. There is no way
/// to raise HealthKit's sheet from a web page, so the card had to end in
/// directions: *open App settings and turn on Workouts*. Which works, and
/// is a worse thing to be told than to simply be asked.
///
/// This is that gap closed. It carries no data whatsoever — the workouts
/// themselves have always gone up through ``SyncClient``, on this app's own
/// schedule, and nothing about that changes. The only thing crossing here is the
/// question.
///
/// ## Throwing the switch *is* the request
///
/// There is no "ask for permission" call to make. ``HealthSync/apply()`` is
/// where `requestAuthorization` lives, and it runs off the `didSet` on
/// ``TrackingSettings/syncWorkouts``. So this sets the setting Settings
/// would have set, and iOS puts its sheet in front of the result — which means
/// the page and the switch cannot disagree afterwards, because there is only one
/// of them.
///
/// ## "ok" means asked, not granted
///
/// Read permission in HealthKit never reports itself. For privacy, Health
/// answers a query the same way whether you said yes or no, and the only way to
/// find out is to ask for data and see what arrives — which is why
/// ``HealthSync/apply()`` has nothing to branch on either. So a `true` here says
/// the sheet was raised and the sync is on, and a refusal shows up later as a
/// sync that finds no workouts. Settings says as much; so does the card.
///
/// ## Not on the Mac
///
/// There is no HealthKit on macOS at all, so there is no `HealthBridge.swift`
/// under `sporra-macos/` and the row is absent from the card there
/// (`permissionsFor` in src/intro.js). An older build of *this* app has no such
/// handler either, and the page falls back to the directions it used to give —
/// which is why the absence is answered rather than assumed away.
