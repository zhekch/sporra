/// Whether the address you typed is a Sporra server, and whether it is up.
///
/// Settings used to answer that only by implication: you typed an
/// address, went back to the map, and either the site appeared or a web view sat
/// there being white. Everything in between — a typo, a server that is down, a
/// tailnet you are not on, something else answering on that port — looked the
/// same from here.
///
/// So it asks. `GET /api/health` is unauthenticated, because this runs *before*
/// there is a session and "wrong address" and "signed out" are different
/// problems that used to be one message.
///
/// ## A 200 is not enough
///
/// On a home network an address with nothing at the other end is rare; an
/// address with the *wrong thing* at the other end is not — a router's admin
/// page, a NAS, some other container on the same box. All of them answer 200 to
/// something. So the check is the body: `{"app": "sporra"}`, and anything else
/// is reported as its own state, in its own colour. "It answered, but it is not
/// your map" is a different sentence from "it did not answer", and it points at
/// a different mistake.
