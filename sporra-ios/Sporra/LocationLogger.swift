/// This is the reason for a native app to exist at all. Everything else here is
/// the web app in a web view, because the web app is better at being itself;
/// this is the one thing a page categorically cannot do, however good it is.
///
/// ## Two services, not one
///
/// **Significant-change monitoring** runs whenever tracking is on, at every
/// cadence. It is not about precision — it is coarse, roughly half a kilometre
/// and whenever iOS feels like it — it is about *survival*. It is the only
/// location service that relaunches a terminated app, so it is what makes the
/// difference between a logger and a logger-until-you-swipe-it-away. It also
/// costs nothing: it is fed by the cell radio doing what it does anyway.
///
/// **Standard updates** run on top of that for every cadence but "only when I
/// go somewhere", and are what the interval settings actually mean.
///
/// ## Why the fixes are coarse on purpose
///
/// `desiredAccuracy` is `kCLLocationAccuracyHundredMeters` at every setting,
/// which is not a compromise — it is the right answer. A cell is about 900 m
/// across, so a ten-metre fix and a hundred-metre fix land in the same hexagon
/// and produce the identical map. What they do not cost the same is power: a
/// hundred metres can be answered from wifi and cell towers, and ten cannot be
/// answered without the GPS chip. Asking for precision this app then throws
/// away would be spending your battery on rounding error.
