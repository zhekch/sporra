/// Health is where everything ends up. A ride recorded on a Watch, a walk from
/// Fitness+, a run from a third-party app that also writes there: they are all
/// already on this phone, already finished, already carrying their route. Going
/// out to somebody's API for them would be a round trip to fetch what is in the
/// next process along.
///
/// ## Only the ones with geography
///
/// Most workouts are not places. A gym session, a swim in a pool, twenty minutes
/// of rowing on a machine — Health records them all and none of them is
/// somewhere anyone went. The filter is not a heuristic about the activity type:
/// it is whether the workout carries an `HKWorkoutRoute`, which is Health's own
/// answer to the same question and is right about the cases a type list would
/// get wrong. An indoor cycle has no route; an open-water swim does.
///
/// ## Sending the same one twice is expected, not exceptional
///
/// The query anchor is a fast path and nothing more. It is lost on reinstall,
/// and Health hands back an *edited* old workout as readily as a new one, so
/// "have I sent this?" cannot be answered by remembering how far we got. The
/// server remembers the ids instead (`device_workouts`), which makes re-sending
/// cheap and exact — and that in turn is what lets this give up halfway through
/// a first sync of eight years of rides without losing its place.

    // line across a pause, and a straight line out to wherever the watch thought
    // it was before it got a GPS lock.
    //
    // **Only the second of those is dealt with here**, and the split is not
    // arbitrary. Cutting a track where the recording stopped needs nothing but
    // latitude, longitude and a clock, which every source has — so it lives in
    // `splitOnGaps` in `src/routes.js` and applies to a Strava ride and a
    // Komoot tour as much as to this. Doing it twice would be two definitions of
    // a pause, quietly disagreeing.

    // fix as CoreLocation hands it over, and it is gone by the time the point is
    // a pair of numbers on the wire.

    /// cell-tower fixes, so how much of that you want is a matter of taste. A
    /// watch recording a walk has GPS lock — a 1,500 m fix in the middle of one
    /// is not a vague reading of where you were, it is the last place the watch
    /// knew about before it locked on. Keeping one drew a 16.7 km line from Thun
