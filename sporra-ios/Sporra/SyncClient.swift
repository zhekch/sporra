/// `URLSession` reaches for without being asked and which persists across
/// launches on its own.
///
/// That it persists at all is a property of the server: `sessionCookie()` in
/// `server/index.js` sets `Max-Age`, so `sid` is a dated cookie rather than a
/// session one, and a phone relaunched into the background at 4 a.m. by a
/// location event still has it. A session cookie would be dropped at every
/// launch and background syncing would quietly never work — which is the sort
/// of thing that looks like a networking bug for a week.
///
/// When the session does end, nothing here can mend it: a 401 is reported up to
/// Settings, which says to sign in on the map.
